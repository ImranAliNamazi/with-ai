Okay, I understand. I'm ready to help you refine your vision and intent. Please share your quotation when you're ready. In the meantime, here are some questions to help you clarify your global undertaking:

* **What are the primary qualities or skills you envision these "sensitive, caring souls" possessing?** (e.g., empathy, communication, conflict resolution, specific healing modalities)
* **What are the key areas of global concern you hope they would address?** (e.g., environmental issues, poverty, social injustice, mental health)
* **How do you envision "magnifying their reach"?** (e.g., technology, education, community building, art, media)
* **What are the potential obstacles or challenges you foresee in implementing this vision?** (e.g., resistance, differing beliefs, resource limitations)
* **What role do you see yourself playing in this global undertaking?**
* **What are the key measurable outcomes you would like to see?**
* **What does "heaven on earth" look like in practical terms?**
* **How do you plan to address the diversity of cultures and beliefs in your global undertaking?**
* **What role does personal responsibility play in this vision?**
