Sri Aurobindo's quote adds a powerful dimension to your vision, introducing the concept of conscious evolution and divine collaboration. Here's a breakdown of its key themes and how it relates to your previous ideas:

## Man's Potential for Transformation:

* Aurobindo emphasizes that human greatness lies not in our current state, but in our potential for transformation. We are vessels for a higher evolution.
* This aligns with your vision of "lightworkers" and "healers" as agents of positive change, but Aurobindo adds a spiritual layer, suggesting a "divine Craftsman" working within us.

## Conscious Participation in Evolution:

* Unlike lower forms of creation, humans have the capacity to consciously participate in their own evolution. Our "free assent," "consecrated will," and "participation" are crucial for the descent of "glory" that will transform us.
* This highlights the importance of individual agency and responsibility in creating a better world, reinforcing the need for inner work and self-awareness.

## Aspiration as Earth's Call:

* Human aspiration is seen as "earth's call to the supramental Creator." This suggests a deep connection between humanity's yearning for perfection and the divine response.
* This provides a spiritual foundation for your vision, suggesting that the desire for "heaven on earth" is not just a human whim, but a cosmic impulse.

## The Possibility of Immediate Transformation:

* "If earth calls and the supreme answers, the hour can be even now for that immense and glorious transformation." This conveys a sense of urgency and possibility, suggesting that the transformation you envision is not a distant dream, but a potential reality in the present moment.

## Connection to your previous ideas:

* The idea of "sensitive caring souls, healers, adepts, lightworkers, seers" can be seen as the earthly manifestation of the "divine Craftsman's" work.
* Magnifying the reach of these people can be seen as the earthly act of facilitating the "free assent, consecrated will and participation" that Aurobindo speaks of.
* The "heaven on earth" concept, matches the "immense and glorious transformation" that Aurobindo describes.

In essence, Aurobindo's quote adds a spiritual depth to your vision, emphasizing the importance of conscious evolution, divine collaboration, and the potential for immediate transformation.
