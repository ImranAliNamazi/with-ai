> `Imran`: So, there are sevveral ideas being dealt with here. I am Imran and I wanted to create such spaces 6 years ago. "We request leaders and communes to begin peer healing and guiding in these creative spaces." - "core principles"<br>
> &bull; That collaboratively we can share valuable insights into the human condition, roll up our sleeves and put ourselves willingly and joyously at the disposal of our brothers and sisters.<br>
> &bull; That health is the right of every individual, group and species. That there are 8 facets of health - Physical / Emotional / Intellectual / Spiritual / Financial / Professional / Social / Environmental.<br>
> &bull; That we are the voice of the disenchanted, misunderstood and neglected. That we will find it in ourselves to fight the good fight and carry the day, serving our deity to the best extent possible.<br>
> &bull; Joy is the "promised land" the Cosmic Consciousness bestows on you for acting inspired and mindful, fully in the moment, following the source of inspiration that comes from every breath.<br>
> &bull; Land is the place where we come together to dream of and then build it into reality.<br>
> &bull; Time - there is only one time in which to act - NOW, so throw away all hangovers of the past, and come back to life, upon the single ACT OF YOUR LOVE.<br>
> &bull; Common Wealth is wealth in common, everyday abundance. A heritage we look forward to, enhancing and enlivening as we pass it on to our progeny.<br>
> &bull; Grace is the sanction of the Divine Lila to give ourselves the freedom to choose or decide which of our many future selves ought to manifest.<br>
> &bull; Aspiration is the passion with which we pursue meaningful, timeless goals. We exert our collective will to become something more than machine, something beyond [wo]man.<br>
> &bull; Accidents - as Oogway says, there are NO ACCIDENTS, only fortuitous incidents playing out just as we in our Swa-Lila planned it all.
