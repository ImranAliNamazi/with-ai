Those two quotations, combined with the 10% statistic, offer a powerful framework for your vision. Here's how they connect and contribute:

* **"Such religion as there can be in modern life, every individual will have to salvage from the churches for himself."**
    * This emphasizes individual autonomy and spiritual self-discovery. It suggests that true transformation comes from within, rather than from external institutions.
    * This aligns with Sri Aurobindo's emphasis on "free assent" and "consecrated will." It reinforces the idea that your venture should empower individuals to find their own path to joy and enlightenment.
* **"Anything you build for them would only become YOUR monument, only when they want it for themselves and do it, does it become theirs."**
    * This highlights the importance of participatory action and ownership. True change requires active involvement, not passive acceptance.
    * This addresses the pitfalls of past utopian attempts, which often imposed top-down solutions. It emphasizes the need for a collaborative, decentralized approach.
* **10% Receptive to Joy:**
    * This statistic provides a foundation for optimism. It suggests that a significant portion of the world is already primed for positive change.
    * It also gives a good base to start from. and that the work to be done, is not as great as it might have first seemed.
* **Catalyzing the Spread:**
    * Your venture's role is not to create joy, but to catalyze its existing presence. This implies a focus on empowerment, connection, and amplification.
    * This is a very important distinction, this is not a top down organization, but a tool to be used by those that want to use it.

**In summary:**

Your venture should aim to create a decentralized, participatory platform that empowers individuals to discover and cultivate their own joy, while connecting them with others who share similar aspirations. By focusing on catalysis rather than control, you can tap into the existing potential for positive change and create a truly transformative movement.
