## Key Considerations for Both Parties:

* Frequent and open conversations between the employee and their manager are crucial.
* Ensure both parties have a shared understanding of the role, responsibilities, and performance standards from the outset.
* Documenting observations and feedback provides a clear record for both sides.
* Encourage open and honest communication about concerns and observations.
* Probation should also be a period of support and development, not just evaluation.
