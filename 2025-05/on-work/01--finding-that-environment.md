> &bull; Why must I sacrifice my time because your organisation is mismanaged, understaffed, overstretched and doesn't care a damn to train, motivate or gimme a life?<br>
> &bull; Effort variance is always a problem because you dont know the first thing about building a mentoring program within the organization, bosses and hr are never on top of keeping their teams best interests at heart, noone cares because they're just paper pushers in a system that doesn't hold everyone accountable, theres slouches, sleazebags everywhere and all the communication lines are broken.<br>
> &bull; Management never cares to keep the internal customers happy, usually dont give a damn, and have a non existent professional development program.<br>
> &bull; Initiative and cross training is never encouraged. We just put up with shittier jobs, longer work hours, unrealistic deadlines and shortage of manpower.<br>
> &bull; Enter the leader who puts the pyramid upside down, gives ownership to the individual and makes everyone accountable to the people below them.<br>

It's understandable to feel this way when one feels undervalued, overworked, and unsupported by their organization. 

Here's a breakdown of some of the key issues you've raised:

**1. Mismanagement & Lack of Support:**

* **Understaffing and Overstretching:** This leads to unrealistic workloads, burnout, and decreased morale. 
* **Poor Training and Development:** Lack of investment in employee growth hinders individual and organizational progress. 
* **Lack of Motivation and Recognition:** Employees feel undervalued and unappreciated, leading to decreased engagement and productivity.
* **Broken Communication:** Poor communication hinders collaboration, creates confusion, and leads to errors and missed deadlines. 
* **Lack of Accountability:** When individuals and teams are not held accountable for their actions, it creates a culture of complacency and mediocrity.

**2. Negative Workplace Culture:**

* **Slouches and Sleazebags:** A toxic work environment can be detrimental to employee well-being and productivity.
* **Lack of Employee Focus:** Management prioritizing their own interests over the well-being of their employees.
* **Poor Internal Customer Service:** Neglecting the needs of internal clients (other departments) creates inefficiencies and hinders overall organizational success.
* **Lack of Professional Development:** Limited opportunities for growth and advancement can stifle employee ambition and lead to high turnover.

**3. Your Proposed Solutions:**

* **Empowerment and Accountability:** Shifting the power dynamic and empowering employees can increase ownership and responsibility.
* **Decentralization:** Smaller, more agile teams can foster greater autonomy and innovation.
* **Demand for Change:** Advocating for a better work culture and refusing to accept the status quo.
* **Holding Management Accountable:** Addressing issues of mismanagement, corruption, and exploitation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Finding a Balance:** While it's important to advocate for change, it's crucial to find a constructive and professional approach. 
* **Exploring Alternatives:** Consider your options, such as seeking a new role within the company, finding a new job at a different organization, or pursuing a different career path altogether.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritize your own well-being and take steps to mitigate the negative impact of your current work environment.
