> `Imran`: So suppose a company called "AuroSpaces.org" was at level 7 towards a "perfectly conscious company" and had a strength of just under 50. What would its code of ethics / way of working booklet look like? use **imaginary names** if wanting to quote people / add messages from various key staff.

That's a fascinating concept! A Level 7 "perfectly conscious company" with a strength just under 50 suggests an organization deeply committed to ethical principles and a mindful way of working, though still on its journey. Their code of ethics and way of working booklet would likely be a living document, reflecting their ongoing evolution. Here's what it might look like:

---

**AuroSpaces.org: Our Guiding Principles - Towards Conscious Collaboration**

**(A Living Document - Version 7.1)**

**Foreword: A Message from Our Guiding Council**

_"At AuroSpaces.org, we believe that our collective consciousness shapes not only the spaces we create but also the impact we have on the world. This booklet outlines our core ethical principles and the ways we strive to work together mindfully. We are on a continuous journey towards a more perfect consciousness as an organization, and this document serves as our compass. We encourage open dialogue and feedback as we evolve together."_ - **Priya Sharma, Lead Facilitator, Guiding Council**

## IV. A Personal Commitment:

This booklet would likely be shared with all new team members and be readily accessible to everyone within AuroSpaces.org. It would serve as a constant reminder of their commitment to a conscious way of working and their ongoing journey towards a "perfectly conscious company." The language would be positive, aspirational, and emphasize collective responsibility. The inclusion of quotes from key staff members adds a personal touch and reinforces the importance of these principles within the organization.
