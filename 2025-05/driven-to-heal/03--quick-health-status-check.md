Absolutely, creating a questionnaire that touches upon the 8 facets of health can provide a comprehensive snapshot for someone in distress and offer valuable insights for a peer supporter. Here is a 10-question questionnaire designed to do just that:

**Taking Stock: A Wellness Check-in**

Please answer the following questions honestly and openly. Your responses will help you and a peer supporter gain a clearer picture of your current well-being.

**Physical Health:**

1.  On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being very poor, 5 being excellent), how would you rate your current physical energy levels and overall physical comfort?
2.  Have you noticed any significant changes in your sleep patterns, appetite, or physical health recently? If yes, please briefly describe them.

**Intellectual Health:**

3.  How engaged and stimulated do you feel mentally these days? Are you finding it easy to focus and learn new things, or are you experiencing mental fog or disinterest?
4.  Are you feeling satisfied with your current level of intellectual stimulation and opportunities for learning and growth?

**Emotional Health:**

5.  How would you describe your predominant emotions over the past few days? (e.g., anxious, sad, calm, irritable). On a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being very negative, 5 being very positive), how would you rate your overall emotional well-being?
6.  How well are you currently able to understand and manage your emotions? Do you feel overwhelmed by your feelings at times?

**Spiritual Health:**

7.  Do you feel a sense of connection to something larger than yourself (this could be nature, a belief system, community, etc.)? Has this sense of connection been impacted recently?
8.  Are you finding meaning and purpose in your life right now?

**Professional Health:**

9.  How satisfied are you with your current work or primary activities (including studies, homemaking, etc.)? Do you feel a sense of accomplishment or stress related to this area?
10. Do you feel supported and valued in your professional or primary activities?

**Financial Health:**

11. How would you describe your current level of financial stress or security? Are financial concerns significantly impacting your overall well-being?

**Social Health:**

12. How connected do you feel to the people in your life (family, friends, community)? Are you getting the social support you need?
13. Are you actively engaging in social interactions that feel meaningful and supportive?

**Environmental Health:**

14. How would you describe the environment where you live and work? Does it feel safe, comfortable, and conducive to your well-being?
15. Do you feel a connection to nature or have access to environments that help you feel calm and grounded?

**Overall Perspective:**

16. Considering all these areas, what feels like the biggest challenge for you right now?
17. What is one small step you feel you *could* realistically take in the next few days to improve your overall well-being in any of these areas?

This questionnaire provides a broad overview. The peer supporter can use the responses to identify areas where the individual is struggling and where they are doing relatively well. It also prompts the individual to reflect on potential first steps towards improvement. Remember, the goal is to foster understanding and offer supportive perspectives and ideas, not to diagnose or provide therapy.
