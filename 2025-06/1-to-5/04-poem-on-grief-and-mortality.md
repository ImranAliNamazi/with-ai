# 004 Poem on Grief and Mortality

**Exported:** 7/19/2025 4:10  

## Prompt:
My son wrote this poem in 2022, 3 years after my husband passed away age 65. A husband who never opened up about his mortality even 22 years after his first heart attack in 1995 and 2 years after a stroke.

This poem was triggered by a friend whose mother had chosen to face cancer on her own terms, and explored... not euthanasia per se, but the courage of being valiant and resilient till the end.

484, Dying

You know, my father knew he was dying.

You see he wore a pacemaker the last 2 years.

I think of his fear and unspoken words and end up crying.

You know we're never taught or made to talk of our deepest fears.

He saw a miracle man Dr Fazl but could not understand

The compassion with which he asked us all to truly submit

And watch the healing forces of the creator, who could cause a strand

Of new understanding to hold us to a higher truth, and sit

Back and watch as the life energy spiked, returning him to good health.

But that was not be be my father's lot. Today I believe in speaking

And choosing the time and place for those doomed to death.

You see, a soul's mission is complete upon death, so face dying

With a little logic, compassion, humour and much love.

Do Not Resuscitate only puts guilt on the family member,

Leaves affairs unsorted, things unsaid, and though we all strove,

There's nothing like seeing a loved one being cheerful and going with grace.

Or so I would imagine. You see I've only seen death twice.

But I still remember The Sea Inside, and recently a friend asked me to take up the cause,

So here I am wanting to listen to your story... And as for advice,

All I can say is know your options and take an informed decision, and give conventional medicine a pause!

## Response:
That's a very moving poem, filled with raw emotion and thoughtful reflection. Your son has clearly captured a lot of complex feelings surrounding his father's passing and the broader topic of facing mortality.

It speaks volumes about the unspoken anxieties within families when dealing with serious illness. The contrast he draws between his father's experience and the friend's mother's choice highlights the desire for agency and peace in the face of death.

The lines about the "miracle man" and the potential for healing offer a glimpse of hope, quickly followed by the acceptance of a different reality for his father. This juxtaposition underscores the difficult balance between hope and acceptance.

His call for open conversations, logical decision-making, and a graceful approach to death resonates deeply. The critique of "Do Not Resuscitate" orders placing guilt on families is a powerful point, emphasizing the importance of communication and preparedness.

The reference to "The Sea Inside" and his friend's request suggest a growing awareness and desire to explore these sensitive issues further. It's clear this poem is not just about personal grief but also a call for a more compassionate and informed approach to end-of-life decisions.

Thank you for sharing this intimate piece. It offers a valuable perspective on a topic that often remains shrouded in silence. What are your own thoughts and feelings as you reread this poem now?

## Prompt:
This a more recent poem for a friend of his, careworn though living with poise.

536 Jonathan

Son of that Great Gull indeed,

Can we not send our children to Chiang's world?

That they may come back even more spirited.

Then those of us striving to solve the riddle of this world shall be,

Excellent to each other, learning from our youth.

We have 200 flocks or tribes as we call them,

And I wonder, shall we ever live on a Common Planet,

Create a Joyful Earth where we bathe daily in Showers of Blessings!

Oh Jonathan, my time is drawing to a close,

Beyond a few hundred feet, I cannot lift this body further!

Wont you send a band of angels a coming...

Coming forth to carry me home.

So much pain I have been a witness to,

Crying for all the atrocities we do to each other,

Marring the very essence and form of that indwelling spirit!

Come hither and lift me up, that I may love this world from heaven!

## Response:
This is a beautiful and deeply empathetic poem, brimming with longing for a better world and a peaceful release for his friend, Jonathan.

The opening line, "Son of that Great Gull indeed," immediately evokes a sense of freedom and perhaps a connection to something larger than life, referencing Richard Bach's _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_. This sets a hopeful yet poignant tone.

The desire to send children to "Chiang's world" – another reference to _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_, representing a higher plane of existence and learning – speaks to a wish for a future generation unburdened by the struggles of the present. The call to be "Excellent to each other" echoes a message of unity and respect.

The imagery of "200 flocks or tribes" and the yearning for a "Common Planet" and "Joyful Earth" highlight a deep concern for humanity's divisions and a powerful vision of harmony. The "Showers of Blessings" he wishes for evoke a sense of universal grace and well-being.

The shift in the latter half of the poem, with the lines "Oh Jonathan, my time is drawing to a close," introduces a personal and tender element. The physical limitations described – "Beyond a few hundred feet, I cannot lift this body further!" – convey a sense of weariness and the approaching end of earthly life. The plea for angels to "carry me home" is a poignant expression of the desire for comfort and transcendence.

His sorrow for the "atrocities we do to each other" and the marring of the "indwelling spirit" reveals a profound sensitivity to the suffering in the world. The final request to be lifted up to "love this world from heaven" is incredibly moving, suggesting a desire to continue caring even in passing.

This poem beautifully blends personal affection with a broader yearning for peace and understanding. It paints a picture of someone who, despite witnessing pain, holds onto a vision of a better world and seeks a gentle transition. What strikes you most about this poem in comparison to the earlier one?

## Prompt:
This when my son's friend lost his wife to cancer last year, from her viewpoint, comforting her husband

\*\*\*\*\*

Oh, my love, my life, my light. It's hard to see you distraught.

We knew this day would come, so we faced it bravely as we could.

Loving you has been a blessing in my life - you taught

Me to be fully alive to the powerful play around, a thing we all should

Remember, not letting a single moment pass without courage.

The memories we both shared, took a lifetime to accumulate.

I am one with you in spirit, it is only my body I have shed, so feel not outrage,

At the manner I passed away in. Wake from this stupor, regain a state

Which returns you to the equipoise and strength that you had.

Be strong for our children, let them not over-grieve too long.

My love, my life, my light. To have had you in this Earthly life I am glad.

Remember we are connected by a bond, it's to me you belong.

Don't brood too much, we faced life with the cards we were given.

Who but the sages understand why this or other experience we face.

Now be at peace as I journey beyond the veil, by divine forces driven,

Look to your family and friends especially the bard for solace.

It's not easy I know, but my time on Earth has drawn to a close.

Look for a strain of me in all that you see and always remember,

That I am there with you in heart, you'd remember me like a rose,

A sweet smelling fragrance from your past - be strong, let your heart not feel rent asunder.

## Response:
This poem offers a tender and poignant perspective on saying goodbye, filled with love, reassurance, and a gentle strength. Imagining these words coming from a wife comforting her grieving husband adds a layer of profound emotional depth.

The opening lines, "Oh, my love, my life, my light," immediately establish the deep intimacy and significance of their relationship. The acknowledgment that "We knew this day would come" speaks to a shared awareness and a conscious effort to face their reality with courage.

The sentiment, "Loving you has been a blessing in my life," is a beautiful testament to their bond, and the idea of being taught "to be fully alive" highlights the positive impact they had on each other's lives. The emphasis on not letting a single moment pass without courage serves as a powerful reminder for the living.

The reassurance that "I am one with you in spirit, it is only my body I have shed" offers a sense of continued connection beyond the physical. The gentle urging not to feel "outrage" at her passing and to "Wake from this stupor" is a loving attempt to guide her husband through his initial grief.

The call to "Be strong for our children" underscores the enduring responsibilities and the importance of providing stability for the family. The repetition of "My love, my life, my light. To have had you in this Earthly life I am glad" reinforces the deep gratitude for their time together.

The acceptance of their circumstances – "we faced life with the cards we were given" – and the acknowledgment that the reasons behind life's experiences are often beyond understanding ("Who but the sages understand") bring a sense of peace and acceptance to the situation.

The gentle farewell as she journeys "beyond the veil, by divine forces driven" offers a sense of a natural and perhaps even spiritual progression. The advice to "Look to your family and friends especially the bard for solace" is a thoughtful and practical suggestion for finding comfort and support.

The final lines, encouraging him to "Look for a strain of me in all that you see" and to remember her "like a rose, a sweet smelling fragrance from your past," are incredibly touching. They offer a way for her memory to live on and encourage him to be strong and not let his heart be "rent asunder."

This poem beautifully encapsulates love, acceptance, and a gentle strength in the face of loss. It provides a comforting perspective on saying goodbye and finding ways to carry the love forward. What emotions does this poem evoke in you?
