## Response:
Excellent! Creating an "All India Journal of Social Work" with state-wise subdomains and Google Scholar indexing is a fantastic way to promote social work research and practice across the country. Here's a breakdown of how to achieve this:

**1\. Website Architecture and Subdomains:**

*   **Main Domain:**
    *   Establish a primary domain (e.g., allindiajournalofsocialwork.org). This will serve as the central hub for the journal.
    *   This main domain will hold the primary journal content, overarching policies, editorial board information, and submission guidelines.
*   **State-Wise Subdomains:**
    *   Create subdomains for each state chapter (e.g., maharashtra.allindiajournalofsocialwork.org, tamilnadu.allindiajournalofsocialwork.org).
    *   Each subdomain will host state-specific content, including:
        *   State-level research and publications.
        *   Local events and conferences.
        *   State editorial board members.
        *   Regional case studies and best practices.
        *   This helps to regionalize the content, and allows each state to have a degree of autonomy.
*   **Technical Implementation:**
    *   Use a robust CMS like WordPress with multisite functionality or a custom-built solution to manage the main domain and subdomains efficiently.
    *   Ensure consistent branding and design across all subdomains.
    *   Implement proper URL structures for SEO and Google Scholar indexing.

    *   Use the "citation\_\*" metadata tags in the HTML header of each article page.
*   **PDF Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure that all articles are available in PDF format.
    *   Make the PDFs text-searchable and properly formatted.
    *   Use descriptive file names for the PDFs (e.g., author\_title\_year.pdf).
*   **Schema.org Markup:**
    *   Implement Schema.org markup to provide structured data about the journal and articles.
    *   Use the "ScholarlyArticle" schema to define article metadata.
*   **Robots.txt and Sitemap:**
    *   Create a robots.txt file that allows Google Scholar to crawl the journal website.
    *   Generate an XML sitemap that includes all article URLs.
    *   Submit the sitemap to Google Search Console.
*   **Stable URLs:**
    *   Use stable and persistent URLs for all articles.
    *   Avoid changing URLs after publication.
    *   **DOI's:**
        *   If possible obtain DOI's for each article. This is very helpful for google scholar.
