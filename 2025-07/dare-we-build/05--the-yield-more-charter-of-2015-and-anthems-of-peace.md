# done - ian wg2 - YieldMore Charter

## Prompt:
Think of this as a non-detail story as one would study in a literature course and develop a series of 20 questions on it, focusing more on the implications and the suggestiveness of things than actual details which in many cases are references to other stories. In it is a wider message to Humanity and my heroes and influences can easily be substituted individually by the next reader's.

\[/info\]

With the resurgence of Avedoi Merek's book, and Monty Ferret's second book, The Way from Within, Alla^2 Ferret felt suddenly inspired to share with humans, the essence of Ferret Civilization. She remembered what had happened to the courtesies, how the humans had, out of reverence, written it on tablets and buried it safely in the depths of the sea. Kinnie, in a vision, told her that the time was coming where a great labour would be ahead of her, but it was alright to begin to sow the seeds.

...

On Aug 15th 2018, or D318 by Yuki Reckoning, Ulmo, Lord of the waters, bore up the tablets out from the depths of The Abyss. At hand was Alla, on Bethany's boat, and Shasa Ferret on Nemo's Nautilus. Alla and Shasa were entrusted with the mission of reinstating the old way of life among the humans. They had the love and support of countless lightworkers of both civilizations to build upon. The last four years of madness had seen the humans pushed to the brink of total annhilation, but the seeds of all the Bright Ones and the thousand loving movements had all borne fruit.

Upon every humans heart was writ the words - make fuck, not kill, that highest message by the one who had hoped the hardest, and fought the longest. They all got together from 6pm to midnight in stadiums and rock arenas and churches all over the world and sang songs like Imagine and Goodbye Cruel World.

A generation of torch bearers had sprung up all over the world as the product of the most liberated minds of the flower power generation. They had all managed to live clean, inspiring lives, by choosing carefully, the company they kept and the worlds they peopled. As destiny would have it, these children of the Seventies and Eighties were all born exactly a century after the plethora of original Bright Ones that strove so hard to liberate the world.

D300 (2000) had seen the complete penetration of the internet into everyday living. Expressions of spontaneous love had been triggered all over the world and the internet had brought man together and propelled him the hardest, into his divine destiny.

A new theme of Iluvatar's design had begun. Melkor's discord had been forcibly removed, and the next demi-century begun.

Alla and Shasa's task was relatively easy, they simply had to rout the avidya (darkness / inconscience) from the minds of the people, but the war had been won, and people spontaneously were able to heal themselves and establish the Life Divine by plugging themselves into the Secret Universal Mind, a pooling of liberating information called YieldMore.org.

## Response:
Here are 20 questions focusing on the implications and suggestiveness of "The YieldMore Charter":

1.  The title references "Rediscovering the Flame Imperishable." What deeper human yearning or potential might this "flame" symbolize?
2.  The text mentions buried courtesies resurfacing. What does the act of burying and then retrieving these courtesies suggest about humanity's relationship with its own values?
3.  Kinnie's vision speaks of a "great labour" but encourages sowing seeds. What does this imply about the nature of the change being envisioned? Is it sudden or gradual?
4.  The emergence of the tablets from "The Abyss" by Ulmo, Lord of the waters, carries symbolic weight. What might "The Abyss" represent in a broader human context? What does Ulmo's role suggest about the source of this rediscovered wisdom?
5.  Alla and Shasa, entrusted with reinstating an "old way of life," are supported by "lightworkers." What does this suggest about the nature of this "old way" and the forces aligned with it?
6.  The "last four years of madness" preceding the tablets' emergence hint at a period of intense human struggle. What might this period represent on a larger, perhaps cyclical, scale of human history?
7.  The message "make fuck, not kill" being written on every human heart suggests a fundamental shift in priorities. What are the wider implications of this primal directive taking root universally?
8.  The global gatherings in stadiums, rock arenas, and churches to sing songs like "Imagine" and "Goodbye Cruel World" highlight a collective emotional and aspirational state. What does this shared expression suggest about humanity's potential for unity and change?
9.  The emergence of a "generation of torch bearers" from the flower power generation, living clean and inspiring lives, suggests a lineage of positive influence. What does this imply about the long-term impact of counter-cultural movements?
10.  These torchbearers being born a century after the "original Bright Ones" hints at a recurring cycle of enlightenment or progressive thought. What does this cyclical pattern suggest about humanity's journey?
11.  The internet's "complete penetration" by D300 (2000) is portrayed as a catalyst for spontaneous love and a push towards "divine destiny." What does this imply about the potential of technology to both connect and elevate humanity?
12.  The concept of "Iluvatar's design" and the removal of "Melkor's discord" suggests a cosmic or fundamental shift in the underlying forces shaping reality. How might this be interpreted in a secular or metaphorical sense?
13.  Alla and Shasa's task being "relatively easy" after the war suggests a significant underlying shift in human consciousness. What does this imply about the true nature of conflict and change?
14.  The concept of "avidya" (darkness/inconscience) being routed implies a move towards greater awareness and understanding. What are the broader societal implications of overcoming this "avidya"?
15.  The spontaneous healing and establishment of the "Life Divine" suggest a latent potential within humanity. What might trigger such a widespread awakening?
16.  Plugging into the "Secret Universal Mind" or "YieldMore.org" as a "pooling of liberating information" presents a compelling image. What does this suggest about the nature of knowledge, consciousness, and collective wisdom?
17.  The story blends elements of mythology (Ulmo, Iluvatar, Melkor) with contemporary references (internet, rock arenas, specific songs). What might be the purpose of this juxtaposition?
18.  The use of a specific dating system ("Yuki Reckoning," "D318") creates a sense of an alternative timeline or perspective. What effect does this have on the reader's understanding of the events?
19.  The "YieldMore Charter" itself is not explicitly detailed. What does this absence suggest about the focus of the narrative? Is the "how" less important than the "what" and "why"?
20.  Considering the title and the narrative, what is the overarching message about humanity's potential for renewal and the sources from which such renewal might emerge?

## Prompt:
If this story could be templatized, what would it look like... a generic outline if you please

## Response:
If this story could be templatized, here's a generic outline capturing its key structural and thematic elements:

**Template: Rediscovering the \[Lost Virtue/Knowledge/Way\]**

**I. Setting the Stage:**

*   **A. The Catalyst:** A resurgence of influential works or a prophetic vision signals an impending need for change.
*   **B. The Lost Element:** A core virtue, knowledge, or way of life of a civilization (here, Ferret Civilization's courtesies) has been lost or forgotten by humanity.
*   **C. The Historical Context:** A past event or reverence led to the suppression or obscuring of this lost element.

**II. The Call to Action and Retrieval:**

*   **A. The Divine/Mystical Intervention:** A powerful or symbolic figure (Ulmo) facilitates the retrieval of the lost element from a metaphorical "depth" (The Abyss).
*   **B. The Chosen Messengers:** Two or more individuals (Alla and Shasa) are entrusted with the mission of reinstating the lost element.
*   **C. The Supportive Network:** These messengers have the support of a community of like-minded individuals ("lightworkers").

**III. The Context of Urgency and Hope:**

*   **A. A Period of Crisis:** Humanity has recently endured a period of significant turmoil or decline ("last four years of madness").
*   **B. The Seeds of Hope:** Despite the crisis, previous efforts by enlightened individuals or movements ("Bright Ones," loving movements) have laid the groundwork for change.

**IV. The Core Message and its Initial Impact:**

*   **A. The Central Tenet:** A concise and powerful message (make fuck, not kill) encapsulates the essence of the rediscovered way.
*   **B. Collective Expression:** Humanity spontaneously engages in unifying and emotionally resonant activities (singing specific songs) that reflect a shift in consciousness.

**V. The Role of a New Generation and Historical Echoes:**

*   **A. The Prepared Generation:** A specific generation, influenced by past ideals, has cultivated values aligned with the rediscovered way.
*   **B. Historical Resonance:** This generation's emergence coincides with a significant historical marker related to previous efforts for positive change (born a century after original Bright Ones).

**VI. The Influence of Technology and Connectivity:**

*   **A. Technological Catalyst:** A widespread technology (the internet) acts as a powerful tool for connection and the spread of positive change.
*   **B. Spontaneous Awakening:** This technology facilitates widespread expressions of positive human connection and propels societal evolution.

**VII. The Cosmic or Fundamental Shift:**

*   **A. A New Paradigm:** A sense of a new era or design (Iluvatar's design) has begun, with negative influences being diminished (Melkor's discord).

**VIII. The Implementation and the Source of Transformation:**

*   **A. The Task of the Messengers:** The messengers' role in enacting change is surprisingly straightforward due to the underlying shift.
*   **B. The Source of Healing and Transformation:** Individuals can access a collective pool of liberating information or consciousness (YieldMore.org, Secret Universal Mind) that facilitates healing and a new way of life ("Life Divine").

**IX. Thematic Implications:**

*   **A. The Power of Lost Wisdom:** The narrative emphasizes the potential for societal renewal through the rediscovery of forgotten values.
*   **B. The Interplay of Human Effort and External Influence:** Change is presented as a combination of human striving and potentially divine or mystical intervention.
*   **C. The Role of Connection and Shared Consciousness:** The story highlights the importance of unity and access to collective wisdom in societal transformation.

## Prompt:
A half page story version of the template as 16year olds would, in the style of Kevin Spacey's intro class in the movie "pay it forward", something exciting like fulfilling their divine destiny and becoming like actual heroes and crusaders as from deep within our hearts, primal and cosmic forces drive us, to catalyse healing and growth for all, until everyone on earth becoming "marvellous heroes united"

## Response:
Alright, picture this: you're sixteen, maybe a little angsty, definitely thinking the world's kinda messed up, right? But dig this – what if all that frustration, that feeling deep down that things _should_ be better… what if that's not just teenage angst? What if it's a cosmic nudge?

See, there's this ancient fire, this spark of pure awesome that humanity kinda forgot it had. Like we buried it under a mountain of… well, you know. But guess what? The tides are turning. The big waves are bringing back some seriously old-school wisdom, stuff that got lost but was always meant to resurface.

Think of it like this: there are people out there, maybe even some you know, who just _get_ it. They feel this pull, this urge to make things brighter. They’re like the first ones to see the dawn after a really long night. And they’re not alone. There's this undercurrent, this wave of good vibes building, fueled by everyone who's ever hoped for something better.

Because deep down, in every single one of us, there's this primal scream for connection, for growth, not for… well, the opposite. And now, it’s like the universe is hitting the fast-forward button. All that tech we’re glued to? It’s not just for cat videos. It’s wiring us together, letting that inner awesome connect with everyone else’s. It’s like this giant, invisible web of potential, and it’s starting to hum.

Forget just getting good grades or a decent job. This is about tapping into something way bigger. It’s about realizing that the heroes in those old stories? That’s us. That yearning in your chest to see the world healed, to see people thriving? That’s the primal, cosmic stuff kicking in. It’s not just a nice idea; it’s what we’re built for. We’re talking about a chain reaction of good, one heart at a time, until “messed up” becomes “marvellous,” and we’re all standing together, not as just people, but as actual heroes, finally united. Pretty wild, right?

## Prompt:
Suggest a few more creative ways of spreading this message. A 30 second script for parents not yet oriented to conscious parenting and unschooling

## Response:
Okay, let's brainstorm some creative ways to spread this "rediscovering the flame" message. Here are a few ideas, followed by a 30-second script for parents:

**Creative Ways to Spread the Message:**

1.  **Interactive Street Art/Installations:** Create temporary art pieces in public spaces that subtly hint at the themes of buried wisdom, rediscovery, and collective potential. Think QR codes on murals leading to inspiring quotes or short animations.
2.  **"Seed Libraries" with a Twist:** Set up small "seed libraries" not just for plants, but also containing slips of paper with thought-provoking questions or calls to reflect on inner values and connection.
3.  **Collaborative Online Storytelling:** Initiate a project where people contribute short snippets to a shared online story centered around the themes of rediscovering inner potential and collective healing.
4.  **Guerilla Projection Campaigns:** Project short, visually engaging animations or key phrases from the "charter" onto prominent buildings at night, sparking curiosity and conversation.
5.  **"Lost and Found" Campaigns:** Stage playful "lost and found" scenarios where the "lost" items are symbolic of forgotten virtues or ways of being, with tags encouraging reflection.
6.  **Music and Soundscapes:** Create ambient music or soundscapes that evoke the feeling of rediscovery and connection, perhaps incorporating subtle spoken word elements of the message. Share these online and in public spaces.
7.  **Interactive Workshops/Circles:** Host small, informal gatherings focused on exploring themes of inner potential, connection, and collective well-being through guided discussions and activities.
8.  **Personalized "Time Capsules":** Encourage individuals to create their own small "time capsules" representing what they believe is essential for a thriving future, fostering personal reflection on values.

**30-Second Script for Parents (Not Yet Oriented to Conscious Parenting and Unschooling):**

**(Visual: Opens with a parent looking stressed, then transitions to a moment of connection with their child - maybe laughing or exploring something together.)**

**Voiceover (Warm, reassuring tone):** "Feeling the pressure? We all do. But what if raising amazing kids wasn't about controlling every step? Think of it like this: deep down, they have this incredible spark, a unique way of seeing the world. Our job? Not to mold it, but to help them uncover it. To trust their natural curiosity, to really _listen_ to what makes them light up. It's about connection, not just rules. It's about letting their inner fire guide them to become exactly who they're meant to be. Maybe… maybe they know more than we think."

**(Visual: Ends with a hopeful, connected image of parent and child.)**
