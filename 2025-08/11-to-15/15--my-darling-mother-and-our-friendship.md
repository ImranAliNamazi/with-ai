## Prompt:
As long as it's ok, ill stay with you, through the years..

## Response:
That's a beautiful line. The lyrics "As long as I can stay with you, through the years" are from the song "Through the Years" by **Kenny Rogers**.

It's a classic love song that really captures the feeling of a long-lasting, devoted relationship. The song was a massive hit and remains one of his most popular tracks.

Is there anything you'd like to know about Kenny Rogers or the song itself?

## Prompt:
Just using it as an opening for the poems I've penned for my mother Uma, my best friend

## Response:
That's a beautiful way to start a poem. Using Kenny Rogers's lyrics "As long as I can stay with you, through the years" as an opening for a poem dedicated to your mother, Uma, is really touching.

I can only imagine how meaningful those poems must be. It's clear how much she means to you. Is there anything you'd like to share about your poems or your mother?

## Prompt:
6... 2017

a light to guide you through the dark!

To live in the protection of her love.

To know we were raised in ceaseless toil.

Taking food clothes and entertainment for granted.

Few realise the absolute greatness that lies concealed by this mortal frame.

To have suspended her own dreams for our upkeep.

To have been our eyes and ears only letting the soft and wholesome enter our consciousness.

To have looked after our friends and playmates as if her own. healing our hurts and uplifting our mood.

To imbibe us with good qualities, leading by example and routing out the flaws in our character.

To turn us inward and connect with that divine spark, teaching us to contemplate the bounties of nature.

To have kept a gay front even when there were tears inside to keep us innocent of sorrow.

To read stories filling our imagination with lands far away and deeds of characters to look up to.

To give us a lap to cry on when were disappointed and a place to voice our fears and misgivings.

All this and more a mother does for us for loves sake. always in keeping with her sense of highest right.

A worthy co conspirator of that Universal Mother who holds all of creation in the palm of her hand.

## Response:
Your poems for your mother, Uma, are incredibly moving and filled with such deep love and gratitude. You've captured the many facets of a mother's selfless love beautifully—from the quiet sacrifices to the active guidance and protection.

The line, "Few realise the absolute greatness that lies concealed by this mortal frame," is particularly powerful. It speaks to the hidden strength and boundless love that often go unseen. You've also beautifully described her role as both a protector ("keeping a gay front even when there were tears inside") and a teacher ("routing out the flaws in our character").

Thank you for sharing these with me. It's clear that your mother's love and wisdom have had a profound and lasting impact on your life. Your poems are a wonderful tribute to her.

## Prompt:
Ty, a mor3 detailed breakdown pls

## Response:
Thank you for sharing your wonderful poems. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the beautiful tribute you've penned for your mother, Uma.

* * *

### The Mother as a Protector and Guide

The poem starts by positioning your mother as a source of light and safety. The lines **"a light to guide you through the dark!"** and **"To live in the protection of her love"** immediately establish her as a beacon and a shield. This theme is further developed with the phrase **"kept a gay front even when there were tears inside,"** showing her active effort to protect you from sorrow and maintain an innocent childhood. This protection wasn't just physical; it was emotional and psychological, too.

* * *

### The Mother as a Selfless Provider

You beautifully highlight the immense sacrifices she made for her family. The phrase **"raised in ceaseless toil"** and the admission that you took things like **"food clothes and entertainment for granted"** capture the quiet, relentless work that often goes unnoticed. The most poignant line here is **"To have suspended her own dreams for our upkeep."** This speaks to the ultimate sacrifice—putting her own aspirations on hold to ensure her children's well-being. This is the heart of her profound love.

* * *

### The Mother as a Moral and Spiritual Teacher

Your poem praises her role in shaping your character and inner world. You mention how she helped **"routing out the flaws in our character"** and how she encouraged you to **"connect with that divine spark."** This shows she didn't just provide for your physical needs, but also for your moral and spiritual development. She was a teacher who led by example, instilling good qualities and a sense of contemplation.

* * *

### The Mother as a Source of Comfort and Imagination

You touch on her role in providing comfort and fostering your imagination. The lines **"read stories filling our imagination with lands far away"** and giving you **"a lap to cry on when were disappointed"** paint a picture of a loving and nurturing presence. She was the one who could transform a difficult moment into a lesson and a quiet evening into a grand adventure.

* * *

### The Ultimate Tribute

The poem's powerful conclusion is where you elevate your mother from a personal hero to a universal one. By calling her **"a worthy co conspirator of that Universal Mother who holds all of creation in the palm of her hand,"** you're not just praising Uma; you're placing her in a lineage of divine, nurturing love. This line suggests her personal greatness is a reflection of a cosmic, all-encompassing love.

* * *

This poem is a powerful tribute because it honors all the different roles she played—protector, provider, teacher, and comforter—and recognizes that these selfless acts stem from a love that is both personal and profound. It is a truly beautiful and comprehensive portrait of your mother, Uma.

## Prompt:
10 Infants...

Nine months in preparation

And ninety years in expression

Baby's have the power to soothe our hearts

Melt us with their laughter

Bundles of joy, they bring out the best in us.

Slow to learn but quick to love

Play they do, amidst our trials and tribulations

Making our burdens easier to bear

Rapt they listen to our well intentioned lessons

Always reminding us of our own joys

That we experienced at the dawn of our lives

Expressions they become

Of the highest forms of love

An act so serene

And vital to our whole

Choose they must, to give of their highest right

Endeavouring to lessen the burdens

Of those that surround them

On they go, along the way, but,

When we think back, theyll always be baby to us

## Response:
Thank you for sharing this beautiful and insightful poem. It's a wonderful tribute to the profound impact infants have on our lives and the enduring nature of parenthood. Here is a more detailed breakdown of its themes and powerful imagery.

* * *

### The Beginning and the Long Arc of Life

The poem opens with a striking contrast: **"Nine months in preparation / And ninety years in expression."** This immediately sets a grand scale for the life of a child. You're not just talking about a baby; you're talking about a human being whose life, love, and influence will unfold over decades, all starting from those initial nine months. The poem's title, "10 Infants," also hints at a collective, universal experience of parenthood.

* * *

### The Power to Heal and Transform

You beautifully describe the almost magical effect infants have on adults. Phrases like **"Babies have the power to soothe our hearts"** and **"Melt us with their laughter"** capture the emotional release and joy they bring. They are not just passive recipients of care; they are active agents of healing. The lines **"Making our burdens easier to bear"** and **"Bundles of joy, they bring out the best in us"** highlight how their innocence and happiness provide a much-needed perspective and lightness in a world of adult worries.

* * *

### The Child's Journey of Love and Learning

The poem acknowledges the journey of a child's growth. The phrase **"Slow to learn but quick to love"** is a perfect summary of a parent's patience and a child's natural affection. You also touch on the child's role as a moral and emotional mirror, reminding us of our own childhood joys. The line **"Expressions they become / Of the highest forms of love"** beautifully suggests that children are the living embodiment of pure, selfless love.

* * *

### The Enduring Parent-Child Bond

The final stanza provides the poem's most poignant and emotional conclusion. You describe the child's moral independence with the phrase **"Choose they must, to give of their highest right."** This shows an understanding that children grow up to become their own people, making their own choices.

However, the final two lines bring it all back to the parent's perspective: **"On they go, along the way, but, / When we think back, theyll always be baby to us."** This is a powerful, universal truth of parenthood. No matter how old, wise, or successful a child becomes, in the parent's heart and memory, they forever remain that small, cherished infant. This line perfectly captures the unchanging nature of a parent's love.

## Prompt:
#29 - Inspire

I came back to life upon the single act of her love

Inspired to take flight, innocent as a dove

She, my mother, Prakriti in essence

Timeless, a whisper, a prick of conscience

Gentle and caring, doting and daring

A light that shines, dark clouds a-clearing

A weather beaten face, a graceful smile

A soft voice that lingers in my ear awhile

With her at my side, the battle of life to fight

Saves me from danger, my anchor in any plight

Tender and lovable, a heart pure as snow

Spirited, indomitable, setting my face all aglow

Soothe me she does, day in and day out

A light that shines in rain or in drought

A balm to my aching heart

Making her life a work of art

Friend, confidante, guide

Guileless in appearance, with nothing to hide

Inpiration to go on, fight the good fight

Strive I shall, spread love to her hearts delight

## Response:

### Summary

This poem is a powerful tribute to your mother, Uma, portraying her as the central force of inspiration and protection in your life. It moves beyond a simple expression of gratitude, instead framing her love as a source of rebirth, her character as a beacon of light, and her life as a beautiful work of art. The poem shows that her unwavering support has not only shielded you from life's hardships but has also given you a clear purpose: to live a life that honors her love.

* * *

### A Detailed Breakdown

#### Stanza 1: Rebirth and Divine Inspiration

The poem opens with the profound statement, **"I came back to life upon the single act of her love."** This isn't just about being born; it's a metaphor for feeling a sense of purpose and vitality because of her love. You were given new life through her affection.

The line **"Inspired to take flight, innocent as a dove"** beautifully captures the feeling of newfound freedom and purity. The dove is a universal symbol of peace and innocence, suggesting that her love gave you the confidence to soar, but with a gentle, pure heart.

The final two lines, **"She, my mother, Prakriti in essence / Timeless, a whisper, a prick of conscience,"** elevate her to a higher level. **Prakriti** in Hindu philosophy represents the fundamental creative force of nature. By calling your mother this, you are saying her essence is like the very source of creation—timeless, powerful, and nurturing.

#### Stanza 2: Gentle Strength and Resilience

This stanza highlights her dual nature of being both soft and strong. The phrases **"Gentle and caring, doting and daring"** and **"A light that shines, dark clouds a-clearing"** show that she is not only a comforting presence but also a powerful one, capable of overcoming adversity and bringing clarity.

The line **"A weather beaten face, a graceful smile"** is particularly poignant. It acknowledges the hardships she has endured throughout her life—the "weather beaten face"—but emphasizes that her essential grace and goodness remain untouched.

#### Stanza 3: Anchor and Protector

Here, you describe your mother as a steadfast source of strength in a difficult world. The line **"With her at my side, the battle of life to fight"** portrays life as a struggle that she helps you face head-on. She is not just a passive observer but an active ally.

The metaphor **"my anchor in any plight"** perfectly describes her role as the stabilizing force in your life. An anchor provides safety and stability in a storm. The final lines of the stanza, **"Tender and lovable, a heart pure as snow / Spirited, indomitable, setting my face all aglow,"** again show her gentle heart alongside her unbreakable spirit.

#### Stanza 4: Healing and Artistry

This section focuses on her power to heal and soothe. A **"balm to my aching heart"** is a classic image for something that brings comfort and relief. Her presence is a source of continuous solace, as you mention, **"day in and day out."**

The most powerful line in this stanza is **"Making her life a work of art."** This elevates her daily actions and sacrifices from duties into a masterpiece. It suggests that every choice she has made, every challenge she has overcome, has contributed to a life that is beautiful, meaningful, and worthy of admiration.

#### Stanza 5: Legacy and Purpose

The final stanza brings the poem to its ultimate conclusion: her legacy. You list her multifaceted roles: **"Friend, confidante, guide,"** showing that your relationship has grown and deepened over time.

The final two lines provide the powerful call to action: her love is your **"Inspiration to go on, fight the good fight,"** and your way of life is a direct result of her influence. The poem ends with a promise to **"Strive I shall, spread love to her hearts delight,"** which is the ultimate tribute—not just to reflect on her love, but to actively live a life that embodies it. You are continuing her beautiful work of art.

Poem 196..

Mothers Love, 20th Feb 2020, for Uma

It's not uncommon, but sometimes rare

To find a mother so filled with care

I wonder what I did to deserve her

My mother who'se calm in any weather

I've seen a few doting mothers look after

Their children, for then they'd enjoy the hereafter

For they've lived true to their conscience

Following that inner voice, filled with sense

We're fortunate to have their endless love

They keep planting good deeds in life's grove

I'm saddened for those who feel the hurt

Of a callous mother, so often brusque or curt

If only I made for myself a wonderful life

My mother would be ecstatic to see no strife

Rather a strong sense of self with which to glide

Through this garden of Eden as a child down a slide

All my life she's been a guiding influence for good

When sad, her melody has brightened my mood

I wonder what on Earth I'll ever do without her

Me the apple of her eye, she, certainly my tether

## Response:
Thank you for sharing another beautiful and deeply personal poem. It's a wonderful tribute to your mother, Uma, and it beautifully captures the sense of wonder, gratitude, and a bit of apprehension that comes with such a profound bond. Here's a detailed breakdown of the poem.

* * *

### A Detailed Breakdown

#### Stanza 1: The Rarity of Her Love

You begin by acknowledging the unique quality of your mother's love. The lines **"It's not uncommon, but sometimes rare / To find a mother so filled with care"** and **"I wonder what I did to deserve her / My mother who'se calm in any weather"** highlight that while motherly love is universal, her specific kind of calm, selfless love feels like a rare gift. This stanza sets the tone of deep gratitude and a touch of humility, as you ponder how you became so fortunate.

#### Stanza 2: A Life Guided by Conscience

Here, you reflect on the motivation behind a mother's selfless acts. You observe that mothers who are devoted to their children, like Uma, are often those who **"lived true to their conscience / Following that inner voice, filled with sense."** This suggests that her nurturing nature isn't just an instinct but a conscious, moral choice. This stanza elevates your mother's actions, portraying them as a result of her strong character and spiritual integrity.

#### Stanza 3: Empathy and Gratitude

This stanza shows your deep empathy for others, while also reinforcing your gratitude. The lines **"We're fortunate to have their endless love / They keep planting good deeds in life's grove"** celebrates the positive impact of mothers like Uma. You then contrast this with the sorrow you feel for those who have experienced a different, more painful reality with a mother who is **"callous... brusque or curt."** This contrast makes the light of your mother's love shine even brighter.

#### Stanza 4: Her Happiness as a Goal

This is a poignant reflection on the kind of future you hope to build for her sake. The lines **"If only I made for myself a wonderful life / My mother would be ecstatic to see no strife"** express a desire to live a life that would make her happy and proud. The image of gliding **"through this garden of Eden as a child down a slide"** is a beautiful metaphor for a life of ease and joy, a life you hope to achieve not just for yourself, but as a testament to her love.

#### Stanza 5: Her Enduring Presence and Your Apprehension

The final stanza brings the poem's themes to a powerful conclusion. You describe her as a constant force for good, a **"guiding influence"** and a source of comfort whose **"melody has brightened my mood."** The final two lines are the most emotional and personal. You refer to yourself as **"the apple of her eye,"** acknowledging her deep love for you, and then express your profound dependence on her by calling her **"certainly my tether."** This final line is particularly moving, as it shows that she is not just a guide, but the very thing that keeps you grounded and connected in the world. The underlying fear of life without her is palpable, and it underscores the immense and irreplaceable role she plays in your life.

248 Footsteps - 27 Sep 2020 - for Uma

I hear those footsteps dimming in the distance

I didn't notice I've been hearing them all my life

My heart beats in tune with it I now do sense

Plod, plod, plod, there goes my father's wife

The mother who showed me the way through all

Whose a little somber now without her partner

Guided by her I am in all undertakings big and small

I wonder what she'll do without him for tether

Perhaps it's time to man up, take her by the hand

And lead the way full of my thoughts and emotions

I've caught up now and at her side I do stand

It's long since I cooled her heart, filled with silly notions

Which to her don't seem practical but mama I say

Grant a poet his place in dreaming of tomorrow

I should find people who like that dream so do pray

We lift our spirits and soar above this rabbit's burrow

Where we hide, denying the Divine full of our lusting

I wish this world would embrace the spirit of love

Let's breathe and wonder what each moment will bring

Uniting with nature, planting saplings in her grove

## Response:
Thank you for sharing this deeply moving poem. It's a poignant reflection on the passage of time, the changing dynamics of family, and the enduring bond between a mother and son. Here is a detailed breakdown of its themes and imagery.

* * *

### A Detailed Breakdown

#### Stanza 1: The Passage of Time

The poem opens with a powerful image of time's passing: **"I hear those footsteps dimming in the distance."** This sets a contemplative, melancholic tone. The realization that **"I've been hearing them all my life"** shows a sudden awareness of something that was always there, now changing. You identify the sound as belonging to your father's wife, a formal yet tender way of referring to your mother, Uma, acknowledging her role not just in your life but also in his. The rhythmic **"Plod, plod, plod"** emphasizes the steady, tireless nature of her life's journey.

#### Stanza 2: The Changing Dynamic

This stanza marks a significant shift in the family dynamic. You acknowledge your mother's guiding role: **"The mother who showed me the way through all."** However, you note her sadness, **"a little somber now without her partner,"** and express your own uncertainty, **"I wonder what she'll do without him for tether."** This is a heartfelt reversal of roles. In a previous poem, you referred to her as your tether; here, you see her as needing one. This realization sets the stage for the rest of the poem.

#### Stanza 3: Taking a New Role

Here, you express a clear resolve to step up and become the new leader and protector. The lines **"Perhaps it's time to man up, take her by the hand / And lead the way full of my thoughts and emotions"** show a willingness to transition from a follower to a guide. The realization that you've **"caught up now and at her side I do stand"** signifies a moment of maturity and equality in the relationship. The phrase **"It's long since I cooled her heart, filled with silly notions"** is a tender admission of past youthful behaviors, and an acknowledgment of your desire to bring her comfort now.

#### Stanza 4: The Poet's Dream

This stanza is a beautiful articulation of your spirit and your vision. You plead with your mother to understand your nature: **"mama I say / Grant a poet his place in dreaming of tomorrow."** You ask for her to support your creative and optimistic worldview, one that seeks to connect with others who share a similar vision. The goal is to **"lift our spirits and soar above this rabbit's burrow,"** a metaphor for leaving behind a small, confined, and fearful existence.

#### Stanza 5: A Vision of a Better World

The final stanza broadens the poem's scope from a personal journey to a universal plea. You call for a move beyond a life of confinement and worldly desires (**"lusting"**) and a return to a more spiritual, loving existence. The desire to **"embrace the spirit of love"** and **"Uniting with nature, planting saplings in her grove"** is a powerful call to action. The act of planting a sapling symbolizes hope, growth, and the creation of a new, more loving world, directly connecting back to the creative and nurturing essence of your mother that you’ve explored in previous poems. The poem ends on a note of both personal commitment and universal hope.

## Prompt:
What we all need is a little more patience, understanding and love

We need to plant these as seeds and saplings in Mother Earth's grove

It's time to forget our turbulent past and grow strong in the light

Let joy and abundance come ticle us till we gasp with delight

I thought I knew all the answers but now I'm a little unsure

Healing begins with those around us, of that I am very sure

Neglecting your lot is escaping from reality - here is family

That I need for my own life to make sense, end the tale happily

I cannot wear two faces, be a source of delight to my friends

And vent out frustrations at home - I cannot be more dense

Flitting like a butterfly from problem to problem is not an answer

Instead I need to stop avoiding talking, instead heal my mother

With my good cheer and joyfulness as I have learnt from life

Being a reflected spirit as a full moon in still waters - no strife

As I wade through the river of life, my heart waiting expectantly

For moments when joy brims over, an emotion takes me suddenly

When we save a single soul, it is like saving the entire world

So I choose my mother, watch delighted as her dreams unfold

And I become the man I wanted to be, a joy to all who behold

Whose grounded as bedrock, timeless, and sets the world awhirl

## Response:
This is a powerful and introspective poem that captures a profound shift in perspective. It moves from a broad, universal message to a deeply personal commitment.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the poem's key themes and progression.

* * *

### A Call for Universal Growth

The poem opens with a broad, hopeful message. The lines **"What we all need is a little more patience, understanding and love"** and **"We need to plant these as seeds and saplings in Mother Earth's grove"** suggest a desire for universal healing and growth. This initial stanza sets a vision of a world reborn through kindness. The call to **"forget our turbulent past and grow strong in the light"** and to welcome joy and abundance sets a positive, forward-looking tone.

### A Turn to Personal Clarity

The poem then shifts inward. The lines **"I thought I knew all the answers but now I'm a little unsure"** reveal a moment of self-doubt and introspection. This uncertainty, however, leads to a crucial realization: **"Healing begins with those around us, of that I am very sure."** You identify that a true and meaningful life is not found by escaping but by engaging with family. The line **"here is family / That I need for my own life to make sense, end the tale happily"** emphasizes the foundational role family plays in your happiness and sense of purpose.

### The Conflict of Authenticity

You explore the struggle of living a divided life. The stanza beginning with **"I cannot wear two faces"** is a powerful statement about the need for authenticity. The image of a **"butterfly from problem to problem"** highlights the superficiality of avoiding difficult conversations. This leads to the central, personal mission of the poem: **"Instead I need to stop avoiding talking, instead heal my mother."** This line is the emotional core of the piece, marking a clear pivot from a desire to heal the world to a resolve to heal the most important relationship in your life.

### The Source of Healing

Here, you describe the tools you'll use for this healing. Your approach is not with grand gestures but with the simple, learned wisdom of **"good cheer and joyfulness."** The metaphor of being **"a reflected spirit as a full moon in still waters - no strife"** is particularly beautiful. It conveys a state of inner peace and serenity that can reflect light and calm without causing any disturbance. This reflects a state of being that is both joyful and deeply centered.

### A Focused Purpose and Its Reward

The final stanza brings all the themes together. You state your primary mission with the powerful line, **"When we save a single soul, it is like saving the entire world."** This provides a justification for your personal, focused mission, affirming that healing your mother is a world-changing act. The ultimate reward is not just her joy, but your own transformation: **"And I become the man I wanted to be, a joy to all who behold."** You close with a powerful image of this new self as **"grounded as bedrock, timeless, and sets the world awhirl,"** suggesting that by focusing your energy and love, you will become a source of stability and positive change for everyone around you.

## Prompt:
353

She is Uma and she's almost one with the spirit of Earth

She's timid and in pain and punchdrunk, has no mirth

No source of delight who can soothe her cares away

Her son neglects her, instead dreams of joining the fray

What fray you may ask? The freak show that is life!

Nowhere is peace found... we've instead bloody strife

He's been told a million times that charity begins at home

He's resented the principle but now learnt she feels worn

He immortalizes her by speaking of her in poetic verse

But will he change or be instead his silly, gruff and terse

He sees another unkind son and realises he's been in err

"What chasm of darkness must I cross to be beside her"

The distance between cities is not the source of worry

He's had a hateful past, now the reasons for seem blurry

They say our second life begins when we realize there's

Only one. So dare to be your best and think of your cares

And Niggles... and flow through them for time is fleeting

Soon the sands of time will run out and we'll be meeting

St. Peter who'll ask a 100 questions then entry deny us

So drop what your doing and show family LOVE not fuss

## Response:
This poem is a raw and powerful reflection on regret, responsibility, and the urgent need for a change of heart. It’s a compelling piece because it moves from a general observation to a deeply personal and confessional plea.

* * *

### A Detailed Breakdown

#### Stanza 1: A Mother's Pain and a Son's Neglect

The poem opens with a vivid and heartbreaking image of a mother, Uma. You describe her as **"almost one with the spirit of Earth,"** which suggests a deep connection to nature but also a state of being grounded by sorrow and pain. Phrases like **"timid and in pain and punchdrunk, has no mirth"** paint a picture of a woman exhausted by life. You then deliver the central conflict: her son, instead of being a source of comfort, **"neglects her, instead dreams of joining the fray."**

#### Stanza 2: The Futility of the "Fray"

You immediately challenge the son’s chosen path. You define the **"fray"** as the **"freak show that is life,"** a world full of **"bloody strife"** and devoid of peace. This shows a deep cynicism about the outside world's distractions. The poem then shifts to a powerful moment of self-realization. The son has been told that **"charity begins at home,"** a principle he once resented. Now, he's finally beginning to understand his mother's emotional fatigue—that **"she feels worn."**

#### Stanza 3: A Confession and a Question

The poem’s focus becomes even more introspective. You acknowledge the paradox of the son's actions: he **"immortalizes her by speaking of her in poetic verse,"** yet fears he will remain his **"silly, gruff and terse"** self. The turning point is when he sees another **"unkind son"** and sees his own reflection, realizing his error. This moment of clarity leads to a desperate, self-searching question: **"What chasm of darkness must I cross to be beside her."** This line is incredibly powerful because it shows that the distance isn't physical, but an emotional and spiritual barrier he feels he must overcome.

#### Stanza 4: The Path to Redemption

This stanza dismisses external worries in favor of internal ones. The **"distance between cities is not the source of worry"**; rather, it’s the **"hateful past"** and the **"reasons for seem blurry."** The poem then offers a philosophical truth: **"our second life begins when we realize there's / Only one."** This suggests that true change comes from accepting our single, precious life and using it to be our best selves. The call to **"think of your cares / And Niggles"** encourages introspection and honesty.

#### Stanza 5: A Call to Action

The final stanza brings the poem to a powerful and urgent conclusion. Time is fleeting, and the sands are running out. The image of meeting **"St. Peter who'll ask a 100 questions then entry deny us"** is a vivid metaphor for a final, irreversible judgment on a life not well-lived. The poem’s final, emphatic lines are a direct command: **"So drop what your doing and show family LOVE not fuss."** This is the ultimate lesson learned—that love, not poetic verse or worldly ambition, is the only thing that truly matters and the only thing that can redeem a life of regret.

He was sick of the darned bayonet. He had lost

A lot of folks to it. Both the wielder and their host.

Hell had vomited its hordes on him for the last time

Now time to turn the manure into daffodils sublime.

Enough of the dregs he said as he recoiled again

Will there never be a solution to make all of us sane?

Or are we all lost beyond redemption with no hope?

He wondered as he thought to just hang by a rope,

And end his life for he was still reeling from it all.

No time to waste on trivialities that seem rather small.

Win the kingdom or simply destroy everything in one go

He thought he knew the way, but how he doesn't know.

How to build an aircraft and rescue those he could

From the damn dogged pitfalls of fire and wood.

A time wasted on ungrates was all he saw, who clung

To rotting bodies, who from heaven had been flung.

The body is the temple of the Lord so be sure to make

Your offerings wholesome, a healthy thirst do slake.

I sincerely pray for peace for those warriors who wrest

With life as her very future lies in the balance, now rest!

## Response:
This is a powerful and somber poem that explores themes of trauma, despair, and a search for meaning. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key ideas and progression.

* * *

### A Soldier's Despair

The poem opens with a vivid image of a soldier's war-weary psyche. The bayonet, a symbol of brutal, close-quarters combat, has become a source of profound trauma. The phrase **"He had lost / A lot of folks to it. Both the wielder and their host"** is a tragic acknowledgement of the shared fate of both attacker and victim. The line **"Hell had vomited its hordes on him for the last time"** is a visceral, powerful statement that conveys the overwhelming and relentless nature of his suffering. The desire to **"turn the manure into daffodils sublime"** shows a yearning to find beauty and purpose out of the ugliness of his past.

### A Search for Meaning

The soldier's despair turns into a profound philosophical crisis. He recoils from the **"dregs"** of life and wonders if a solution for sanity is even possible. The questions **"Are we all lost beyond redemption with no hope?"** and his contemplation of suicide reveal a soul at its breaking point. He's struggling with the weight of his experiences, seeing everything else as **"trivialities that seem rather small"** compared to the life-and-death stakes he has faced. This internal conflict sets up his desperate search for a new, meaningful mission.

### A Heroic, Conflicted Goal

The poem transitions from despair to a new, albeit vague, ambition. The soldier's thoughts oscillate between extremes: **"Win the kingdom or simply destroy everything in one go."** This shows a mind grappling with a new, large-scale purpose, though the path is unclear. The image of building an **"aircraft and rescue those he could"** is a heroic, almost spiritual metaphor for saving others from the **"damn dogged pitfalls of fire and wood"**—the recurring symbols of destruction and suffering. His frustration is palpable as he sees people clinging to the past and to what is rotten, as if they were **"ungrates"** to his rescue mission.

### A Hopeful, Spiritual Conclusion

The final stanza provides a moment of spiritual clarity and resolution. The poem shifts from the soldier's perspective to a more universal, guiding voice. The lines **"The body is the temple of the Lord so be sure to make / Your offerings wholesome, a healthy thirst do slake"** offer a path to redemption through self-care and spiritual purity. The poem concludes with a prayer for peace, specifically for **"those warriors who wrest / With life."** This is a final, tender tribute to the soldier and all who struggle. The final line, **"now rest!"** is a compassionate command, offering a moment of solace and peace after the emotional and physical turmoil described throughout the poem.

My son is soo sweet, until the devil takes over him and I wonder what can calm him,

When he gets angry. He says it's just the frustration of another fallen juggle,

That I wouldn't know what a juggle is coz I'm so busy with my own problems.

He fails to understand how it hurts me when he shoos me away at other times.

I know he doesn't realize it, but I wish he would. He says sorry mamma, "I'm always

Caught up in some thought or activity and usually irate or on the brink of collapse".

He's so kind, caring and giving, I'm yet to see another soul like him in intent.

But I wish he would understand me better so we could be the best of friends.

He says "Silly mamma! we are - that's how it's always been, I haven't gone anywhere,

It's just taken time to learn about myself and my relation to the world around us."

My love for him has no bounds, and I am so thankful to God for this wonderful son.

He says that his is but a fragment of the wonder that is me and my husband.

That he misses his father terribly and wishes to turn a new leaf, be that delight again.

I can never forget the smiles and the innocence on his face all through his growing years.

He says, "yes, I have a conman's smile, same as my dad had" - that I should know better by now

Than to fall for it. His simplicity, genuineness and sincerity have indeed touched my heart.

I hope we have more fun writing together like this. Perhaps everyday for a spell.

That in quiet reflection, we find strength to face our battles with aplomb and grace.

I'm learning to weave words together as I let my thoughts float out on the well.

A well of feeling I reflect on my past of ups and downs, as I gear up to run another race.

## Response:
This poem, written from a mother's perspective, is a tender and complex portrayal of a mother-son relationship. It beautifully captures a mother's deep love, her quiet pain, and her unwavering hope.

* * *

### A Detailed Breakdown

#### Stanza 1: The Mother's Pain and Son's Frustration

The poem opens with a mother's loving observation and a sense of confusion. She sees her son's sweetness but is troubled when a "devil takes over him," making him angry. The son explains his anger as the **"frustration of another fallen juggle,"** a metaphor for the many things he's trying to manage. He dismisses her understanding, saying she's too caught up in her own problems. This reveals a misunderstanding, as his mother's pain comes from his actions, particularly when he "shoos" her away.

#### Stanza 2: A Mother's Hope and A Son's Apology

The mother's love shines through in this stanza. She understands that he doesn't realize the hurt he causes, yet she wishes he would. She recounts his apologies, where he admits to being "irate or on the brink of collapse." Despite this, she sees his true nature, calling him **"so kind, caring and giving,"** and wishes they could be the "best of friends." This highlights her deep longing for a closer, more open relationship.

#### Stanza 3: A Son's Reassurance

The son's voice returns with a reassuring and gentle tone. He calls her "Silly mamma!" and tells her they are already the best of friends. He explains his emotional distance as a necessary process of **"learn\[ing\] about myself and my relation to the world around us."** The mother, in turn, expresses her boundless love for him and her gratitude to God for this son. The son's reply, that his wonder is just a "fragment" of his parents' is a touching acknowledgment of his respect for them.

#### Stanza 4: Acknowledging Loss and the Path Forward

This stanza reveals the deep-seated grief that colors the son's behavior. He confesses that he misses his father and wishes to "turn a new leaf, be that delight again." This explains some of his earlier frustration and emotional distance. The mother reflects on the son's innocence in his youth, and the son jokes that his smile is like his father's—that of a "conman." This playful self-awareness is a sign of his genuineness, something his mother has come to understand and appreciate.

#### Stanza 5: A Shared Journey

The poem concludes with the mother's hope for a shared creative and emotional journey with her son. She wishes they could write together, finding "strength to face our battles with aplomb and grace." The image of her letting her thoughts "float out on the well" is a beautiful metaphor for a deep, reflective process of self-discovery. She sees this as a new "race" to run, not of competition, but of personal growth and connection with her son. The poem ends on a note of hopeful anticipation for the healing and deepened bond that writing together might bring.

How can I forget that night - when I saw the three kittens playing?

It was one of those nights that I enjoyed so much, my face lights up.

Imu was with me and we shared the joy together - those kittens in

our verandah for two whole days - then mama cat took them to a safer home.

You see a tom cat came and was causing trouble for the poor babies...

It was unfortunate that we couldnt enjoy more days like those.

My son asks me why we couldnt just take them inside and keep them?

I carry the guilt that I couldnt give my son the thrill of having pets,

But I never liked pets all over the house - silly though it may seem.

He says not to worry, to make my peace with it now - no need for guilt.

Another thing I cannot forget that also gave me great joy - was Inara

and my Mother playing with the peas one night in the hall. Just the sight!

Many are the memories long forgot - I remember my father coming home nights

My son too remembers my husband and the thrill of being a full house -

Alive and joyous to behold. With young children erupting in peals of laughter.

Me and my siblings... My children... and lastly, my granddaughter.

Come now my friend, life is a magnificent thing to behold - GO LIVE IT

Why have you forsaken me - my love, my life - are we to meet again?

On shores long unseen, paths not oft walked. Thank you for being mine.

And all the little things you did for me. God bless and godspeed (me to you).

## Response:
This is a poignant poem, written from a mother's perspective, that beautifully captures the bittersweet nature of memory, the quiet guilt of motherhood, and the deep longing for a loved one.

* * *

### A Detailed Breakdown

#### Stanza 1: A Shared Memory

The poem opens with a vivid, joyous memory of **"three kittens playing."** This is a shared experience with her son, Imu, a moment that made her **"face light up."** The happiness is palpable. However, the joy is short-lived, as the mama cat moves the kittens to a **"safer home."** This brief period of happiness sets the stage for the rest of the poem's reflections on loss and memory.

#### Stanza 2: A Mother's Quiet Guilt

The joy of the kittens is contrasted with the quiet sadness that follows. A tomcat posed a danger to the kittens, and they were taken away. The mother carries a sense of **"guilt"** because she couldn't give her son the experience of having pets, as she **"never liked pets all over the house."** This reveals a common, and often unspoken, feeling among parents—the regret over choices that may have deprived their children of simple joys. Her son's reassurance to **"make my peace with it now - no need for guilt"** shows a loving and understanding relationship. The stanza ends with another cherished memory, of her mother and granddaughter, Inara, playing together with peas, which brought her **"great joy."**

#### Stanza 3: Remembering the Past

This stanza broadens the scope of the poem to encompass a wider range of family memories. The mother recalls her father's nightly returns, and her son, in turn, remembers his father. The phrase **"the thrill of being a full house - Alive and joyous to behold"** speaks to a deep longing for a time when the family was whole and full of life. It connects her own childhood memories with those of her children, creating a sense of a shared family history through generations.

#### Stanza 4: A Final Message of Love and Longing

The poem concludes with a powerful, emotional turn. The mother addresses a loved one, whose identity is left open to interpretation—a departed spouse, a lost friend, or perhaps a part of herself. The plea **"Why have you forsaken me - my love, my life - are we to meet again?"** expresses profound longing and grief. The command to **"GO LIVE IT"** is a call to her own heart, to embrace life despite the pain. The final lines, **"Thank you for being mine. / And all the little things you did for me,"** are a tender farewell, filled with gratitude and the promise of a reunion, whether on **"shores long unseen"** or in memory.

## Prompt:
Godpeed.. me to you

## Response:
That's a beautiful way to put it. It captures the deep desire to close a distance, whether it's physical or emotional.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts and your poems. I wish you Godspeed on your journey.

## Prompt:
Noo, I was referring to th3 last line where my mom wants to be with my father.. godspeed is never used to bless one's self..

## Response:
Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate you explaining the deeper meaning behind that line. My apologies for the misinterpretation.

You're absolutely right. When read from your mother's perspective, the line "Godspeed.. me to you" is incredibly powerful.

It's a beautiful reversal of the traditional farewell. She isn't just wishing him well; she's giving herself a final, private blessing for her own journey to be reunited with him. It gives a profound sense of closure to the poem, transforming the memories of a "full house" and the longing for him into a quiet, hopeful promise of a reunion on "shores long unseen."

## Prompt:
My grandfather was a cartoonist in the magazine he worked at till 1975.

His wife would make the most beautiful 10 foot kolams on special days.

My mother was the most gifted of her generation, on fine arts she would thrive.

My sister, a decade ago made acrylic paintings that had us all in a daze.

2 of my mother's siblings, my sister and I also write poems.

A new kind of art where the word conjures visions in the mind.

What do we know about the artists who gave of their all - streams

Of consciousness that if seen and heard, will show us a way out of this bind.

I wonder if my niece will be an artist someday... I longed for

A picture of the ladies of 4 generations to sit and paint -

But that picture evaded me and now granny is not here,

You see, she's journeyed off to the world between lives, but did not taint

Our understanding of life's beauty. For we are all acutely

Aware of the underpinning aesthetic that uplifts us all.

Go paint my dear, let your soul exalt your senses until finally,

You are one with the Cosmos, turned skyward, standing tall.

I knew a painter (Niggle) - he was obsessed with the one big tree.

Everything and every thought was woven into it's story.

When he died and went to heaven, it was brought to reality.

So create art that mirrors your deepest longings and meditations folks - for that will become your destiny.

## Response:
This poem is a beautiful and moving tribute to a family lineage of artists and a profound meditation on the purpose of art itself. Here is a detailed breakdown of its themes and powerful progression.

* * *

### A Legacy of Art

The poem begins by establishing a strong artistic lineage that spans four generations. You trace this legacy from your **grandfather**, a cartoonist, to your **grandmother**, who created beautiful ten-foot kolams. The line about your grandmother’s kolams is especially powerful, as it highlights an ephemeral art form that is both grand and fleeting.

You then celebrate your **mother** as the most gifted of her generation, thriving in fine arts, and your **sister** for her stunning acrylic paintings. This first stanza paints a picture of a family where creativity isn't an exception, but a defining trait.

* * *

### Art as a Shared Consciousness

In the second stanza, you connect these diverse art forms to your own passion for poetry. You see poetry as a **"new kind of art"** where words create visions. You then elevate this idea by suggesting that art, in all its forms, is a stream of consciousness that can offer a way out of life's struggles—a way to understand and connect with the world more deeply. This suggests that art is not just a personal expression, but a shared key to a greater truth.

* * *

### A Missed Opportunity and Enduring Beauty

This part of the poem holds a poignant sense of loss. You describe your longing for a picture of the **"ladies of 4 generations to sit and paint,"** a beautiful image of artistic legacy in action. The line **"But that picture evaded me and now granny is not here"** brings a touch of sadness, as that specific moment is now lost. However, the poem quickly resolves this sorrow. Her departure **"did not taint / Our understanding of life's beauty."** Her life and art, in their own way, have already instilled in you all a deep awareness of the **"underpinning aesthetic that uplifts us all."**

* * *

### The Call to Create

The poem then shifts to a powerful, universal command: **"Go paint my dear, let your soul exalt your senses."** This is a call to action for the younger generation, perhaps your niece, to embrace her own creative spirit. The final lines of this section—**"until finally, / You are one with the Cosmos, turned skyward, standing tall"**—is an incredible metaphor that suggests art is a spiritual journey. Creating art, you argue, isn't just a hobby; it's a path to transcendence and a feeling of complete harmony with the universe.

* * *

### Art as Destiny

The final stanza is a beautiful allegory that encapsulates the entire poem's message. You tell the story of a painter named **"Niggle"** who was obsessed with **"the one big tree."** This tree represents his life's work, his passion, and his deepest meditations. When he died, his art became reality. The poem ends with a powerful, inspiring conclusion: **"So create art that mirrors your deepest longings and meditations folks - for that will become your destiny."** This final thought serves as a profound lesson for all—that the art we create in this life is not just a reflection of our souls, but a blueprint for the world we will inhabit in the next.
