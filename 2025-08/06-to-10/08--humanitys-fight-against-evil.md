## Prompt:
If bad #leaders come from a bad #society and are elected by us,

And our bs #radars are never up to not be swayed by #propaganda,

What's the point, #humanity, in crying at this or other outrage, even #genocide?

I still maintain it's the last #fight of the evil #forces and they are soon to be #driven out!

Driven out of our collective #psyche, but who is to heal the #tainted #soul of the #abhorrent?

The Day the Earth stood still tells of an Alien civilization wanting to #expunge us,

Is that day today I wonder? And who will fight for Earth?

Will the call of peace be heard? Goldberg's or Merek's cry?

The #eucatastrophe nears with each day, but who will sue for pardon?

And beg our intercessors to pray for #Divine #Grace?

Weve forgotten the words of love that #Krishna, #Buddha, #Christ and #Mohammed bore us!

Can the tide of human #destruction be reversed?

Reversed by a #collective voice of #peaceful #warriors who CRY -

We withdraw our #CONSENT from #EVIL, no longer letting #rape and mass #murder be the norm.

Not letting any "faith" #divide us, perhaps it's time for #pluralism to reign.

So go #within, those of you who realise, that it's only #love can #conquer.

Save a #damned soul from endless hell-fire, like #RaisBhuiyan did some decades ago.

Follow the true #nature of #yourself, not this #mindless and wanton #perpetration of #hate.

Is our time up? I wonder? Or can we #stem the tide?

What means to live a #LifeDivine? Desist from allowing evil to #perpetrate else woe betide!

## Response:
Your powerful and deeply felt post raises some of the most profound questions about the state of humanity. You've touched on a fundamental paradox: we are the ones who elect our leaders, yet we often feel powerless against the forces of propaganda and evil they represent. The cycle of electing bad leaders and then crying outrage seems to create a perpetual state of despair.

Your mention of _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ and the idea of an external force judging and potentially expunging humanity resonates with a feeling many share—a sense of impending doom and the hope for some kind of intervention. However, you also offer a counter-narrative, one of hope and inner strength. You suggest that the real battle isn't with external aliens, but within ourselves.

This is a beautiful and potent idea: the concept of withdrawing our **consent** from evil. This perspective shifts the power from the leaders and the systems they control back to the individual. If enough people were to collectively and consciously withdraw their consent from actions of hate, greed, and violence, the very foundation of those systems would crumble.

You've highlighted a path forward, a **Life Divine**, which you define not by outward religious devotion but by an inner alignment with love and truth. The call to "go within" and follow the "true nature of yourself" is a powerful message. It's a call to find our common humanity, to remember the core teachings of love and peace from figures like Krishna, Buddha, Christ, and Mohammed. This isn't about one faith conquering another, but about realizing the unifying thread that runs through them all.

Your reference to **Rais Bhuiyan** is particularly inspiring. His story of forgiving the man who shot him is a powerful example of an individual choosing compassion over vengeance. It’s a testament to the idea that a single person, by living a "Life Divine," can begin to reverse the tide of human destruction.

Ultimately, your post presents a choice: do we accept that our time is up, or do we believe that we can still **stem the tide**? The path you've outlined suggests that we can, but it requires a fundamental shift—a collective awakening to our own power to choose love, peace, and pluralism over division and hate. The fight is not over, and the first step is to recognize that we are not powerless.

## Prompt:
Is it the hour?

When we break the chain

When we get rhythm

When love will keep us alive

When we have no more civil war

When we fly up and find a meaning to life

When we relearn the courtesies

When we let our angels guide us

When we build a heaven, no longer vengeful

When history teaches us NOT to fight

When truly we forgive and move on

When we renew our faith in humanity

When we seek forgiveness for our trespasses

When philosophers keep it short and sweet

When artists inspire us to find ourselves

When engineers and teachers truly inspire

When a new spirituality rises from our depths

When the human instincts are hallowed and heightened

When our community is teeming with life

When our cultures and faiths join hands

When we draw \[s\]words together

Is it the hour…

Of the symbol dawn, when the very Gods awake

## Response:
Your beautiful poem asks a powerful question, "Is it the hour?" It's a question of timing, of hope, and of readiness. You're not asking if it's the hour for a new year or a new day, but for a new **era** for humanity. You're asking if we've finally reached the tipping point where all the lessons of history, all the suffering and sorrow, will finally be transformed into something magnificent.

The imagery you use is both grand and intimate. You speak of breaking chains and finding rhythm, of forgiving and renewing faith. You're talking about a collective spiritual awakening, where our deepest instincts are "hallowed and heightened" and our communities are "teeming with life." You’re envisioning a world where we draw **swords together** not to fight each other, but to defend and build a better world. A world where our cultures and faiths don't divide us but join hands in a shared purpose.

Your closing lines, "Is it the hour… Of the symbol dawn, when the very Gods awake," suggest that this isn't just a human project, but a cosmic one. It's a moment so significant that it would be felt on every level of existence.

We can't say for sure if it's the hour. But what we can say is that the possibility is always there. The poets, the artists, the philosophers, the teachers, and the engineers you mention—they are the ones who help us feel it, to see it, to prepare for it. The hour may not have a clock. It may be less about waiting for a specific time and more about each of us acting as if it is **right now**, in this very moment. Perhaps the “hour” is not something that arrives on its own, but something we must usher in with every conscious choice we make.
