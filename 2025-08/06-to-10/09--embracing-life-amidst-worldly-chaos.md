# 09--embracing-life-amidst-worldly-chaos

## Prompt:
The world is gone crazy - there are people

 - Inventing Convoluted Ways to SAVE it

 - Busy screwing us and running off to the bank with all the MONEY

 - Caught in the mire of living

Life is a blessing peeps, come LIVE IT!

## Response:
It sounds like you're feeling a lot of frustration and concern about the state of the world and the different paths people are taking. You've hit on some significant, and often conflicting, human pursuits.

There are indeed people pouring their energy into finding **convoluted ways to save the world**, whether through complex scientific innovations, ambitious policy reforms, or grassroots movements. This often comes from a deep-seated desire to make a positive impact and ensure a better future.

At the same time, we see the stark reality of others who seem to be **focused on personal gain at the expense of others**, accumulating wealth and power without regard for the consequences. This creates a sense of injustice and can make it hard to feel optimistic.

And for many, the day-to-day is a struggle—they're **caught in the mire of just trying to live**, to get by, and to navigate the complexities of life. For them, grand schemes and global issues might feel distant or even irrelevant when their primary focus is on survival and well-being.

Your call to "come LIVE IT!" is a powerful reminder that amidst all these extremes, there's a fundamental value in appreciating and engaging with life itself. It's about finding joy, purpose, and connection, regardless of the chaos around us.

What does "LIVING IT" mean to you in this context?

## Prompt:
to find the poetry through the pain, submit to a higher reasoning, and to ALWAYS remember that life is not about the number of breaths we take but the moments that take our breath away

## Response:
That's a beautiful and deeply insightful way to define "LIVING IT." It suggests a path that moves beyond simply existing and instead embraces the full spectrum of human experience.

*   **Finding the poetry through the pain** speaks to the resilience and perspective needed to find meaning and beauty even in difficult times. It's about seeing struggle not just as suffering, but as a source of growth, wisdom, and profound moments.
*   **Submitting to a higher reasoning** points to a surrender of control and an acceptance of something greater than oneself, whether that's a spiritual belief, a universal order, or simply the flow of life itself. This can offer a sense of peace and purpose amidst chaos.
*   And of course, the classic but always powerful idea that **life is not about the number of breaths we take, but the moments that take our breath away** reminds us to prioritize quality over quantity. It's a call to seek out experiences that fill us with wonder, joy, and a sense of being fully alive.

Together, these ideas paint a picture of a life lived with intention—one that doesn't shy away from pain, finds peace in submission, and actively seeks out moments of awe. It's a powerful philosophy for navigating a world that often feels out of control.

## Prompt:
consider this song of Karen Carpenter... in her gentle wafting voice

Where's the word for the sadness

Where's the poetry in the pain

Where's the color in the stain where the tears have fallen

It's gone, it's just gone

Where's the method to this madness

As we create this suffering

And we do each other in and we still hold on

But it's gone, it's just gone

He says it's gone

And he can't go on a living a memory

Mulling it over endlessly

Why is that so hard for me to see

He says it's gone

And he can't go on trying to live a lie

And when he cries, I know it's over

But I may never know why

There's no face in the locket

There's no place for the past

I'll put it back in my pocket

It was never meant to last

It's just gone

He says it's gone

And he can't go on a living a memory

Mulling it over endlessly

Why is that so hard for me to see

He says it's gone

And he can't go on trying to live a lie

And when he cries, I know it's over

But I may never know why

There's no word for the sadness

There's no poetry in the pain

There's no color in the stain where the tears have fallen

It's gone, it's just gone

It's gone, it's just gone

Well, it's gone

## Response:
Karen Carpenter's voice has a way of embodying a profound, gentle sadness. It's a voice that can make you feel the lyrics on a deeper level. This song you've shared beautifully captures a specific, heartbreaking moment in a relationship.

The lyrics move from an external observation of the world to a deeply personal experience of loss. Initially, the song asks where the "poetry in the pain" and "color in the stain" have gone. It's as if the narrator is trying to find a grand, philosophical explanation for her suffering, a way to make it beautiful or meaningful.

Then, the song narrows its focus to the core conflict: he is ready to move on, while she is not. He says, "it's gone," but for her, the feelings and the memories are still very much present. She can't understand his ability to simply let go. This contrast creates a poignant tension between two different emotional realities.

The line, "I'll put it back in my pocket, it was never meant to last," is particularly powerful. It suggests a reluctant acceptance of the truth, even if she doesn't fully grasp the "why." This act of putting the past away, like a forgotten locket, signifies the end of the journey and a kind of submission to the finality of the situation.

This song beautifully illustrates the difference between accepting the intellectual reality of a breakup and accepting it emotionally. The narrator's struggle is not just with the loss of the relationship, but with the loss of the meaning she attached to it. The song's final refrain, "It's gone," is a chilling, a-capella echo of that harsh reality.

## Response:
Thank you for sharing that profound and beautiful piece of writing. It's a powerful expression of your personal philosophy, and it provides a deeper understanding of what "LIVING IT" means to you.

Your prose, in the spirit of a devotional hymn or a long, flowing poem, seeks to capture the ineffable by cataloging its many manifestations. You don't just state a belief; you show it through an overwhelming cascade of images, from the cosmic to the deeply personal.

### Seeing the Divine in All Things

Your piece on **Mahakala** and **Mahakali** isn't just about two deities; it's a vibrant tapestry that weaves together countless concepts to form a unified vision of the divine.

*   **Mahakala** is depicted as the ultimate source—"substrate of all that is," "silent witness," and "void" that is also "throbbing like the big electron." This figure isn't a distant, singular god but a dynamic, ever-present force in everything from the sub-atomic to the stars. The divine masculine is seen in the resilience of rock, the wisdom of a sage, and the creative force in art and music. It's the "refuge of the righteous" and a "reminder to the fallen," showing a presence that is both compassionate and uncompromising.
*   **Mahakali** is described as the "seed of creation," the "nurturer," and the "executrix." The divine feminine is the living, breathing energy of the universe, present in the "courting in the veins," the "fragrant flower," and the "voice in the wilderness." You connect her to a vast array of goddesses and powerful feminine figures from different traditions, from Sita and Radha to Mary and Melian. This highlights a universal, nurturing, and sometimes sorrowful aspect of the divine that is a "comforter at the pass into death" and a "womb of the universe."

In essence, your writing defines "living it" not as a single action but as an ongoing act of recognition. It's the practice of seeing this divine presence—both the expansive, timeless Mahakala and the creative, nurturing Mahakali—in every aspect of existence: in nature, art, music, relationships, and even in moments of grief and hardship. It's a philosophy that makes the mundane sacred and turns the ordinary into a constant encounter with the extraordinary.

## Prompt:
thanks. now poem 16 - nature

To smell a garden after it rains

To stand under a waterfall beside one you love

To take children for a picnic in the countryside

And stop in a wood to recharge

That well from which love and beauty flow

Deer and bears, squirrels and parrots

Of the best of God's creations

And us, the crown

Who stop subjugating nature

And instead, live in harmony with it

Feeling the fall of every little flower

We've stopped killing in the name of food

Hunters turned to guides,

Taking us deep into forests

To see where elephants inhabit the place

And monkeys frolic in sweet innocence

Bringing out in us deep wells of love,

For the plants and animals that share this planet

Unstained by lust or greed

We've come full circle and found everlasting peace

## Response:
Thank you for sharing your poem. It paints a beautiful picture of a world where humanity has found its rightful place in harmony with nature.

The poem begins with simple, sensory pleasures—the smell of a garden after rain, a waterfall shared with a loved one, a picnic in the countryside. These are the small, pure joys that reconnect us to the earth.

The central theme is a shift in humanity's role. We are described as "the crown" of creation, but your poem redefines what that means. Instead of dominating nature, we learn to live **in harmony with it**. The shift from "subjugating" to "living in harmony" is a profound change in perspective, moving from a relationship of power to one of partnership.

You portray a world where hunters become **guides**, leading people to see the beauty of elephants and the innocence of monkeys, rather than to kill them. This transformation shows a new kind of respect for all life. The poem suggests that this new way of living unleashes "deep wells of love" within us.

The final lines, "Unstained by lust or greed / We've come full circle and found everlasting peace," are the perfect conclusion. They suggest that true peace and fulfillment come not from conquering the world, but from recognizing our interconnectedness with it. It's a vision of paradise not in the distant future, but here on Earth, once we choose to live with love and respect for all living things.

## Prompt:
this #20 - teeming with life

Sometimes it calls upon our hearts to step

Away from the bustle and humdrum

And awaken that silent builder within us

Who knows the need of the hour

And renders every hurdle to progress

To a quiet dissolution in the cauldron of life.

Reshape we do, that stream of activity

Around us until the possibility of greatness

Is achieved and we've made something special.

Fashioned by our hands, guided by

That divine craftsman who waits patiently

For His designs to become fully wrought.

For carefully laid were His plans

And us only the instrument of his execution.

Push us forward he did to build

Better and better things, labouring

In timeless halls where we learned

To intuit His every whim,

Until we'd built an entire community

Of souls simply teeming with life.

## Response:
The poem you've shared, "teeming with life," is a beautiful and inspiring piece about purpose, creation, and community.

It begins by describing a feeling of being called away from the ordinary to awaken a **"silent builder within us."** This suggests that we all have a creative, purposeful part of ourselves that often gets lost in daily life. This builder knows what needs to be done and has the power to overcome challenges, dissolving them "in the cauldron of life."

The poem then shifts to the idea of **co-creation.** We are the instruments, the hands that do the work, but we are guided by a "divine craftsman." This craftsman patiently waits for his plans to be fulfilled. This perspective takes the pressure of being the sole creator and instead frames our actions as part of a larger, more perfect design. It implies that our true work is to listen and learn to "intuit His every whim" so that our creations can be aligned with a higher purpose.

The final lines bring this idea to its ultimate conclusion: the result of this co-creation isn't just a single "something special," but an **"entire community of souls simply teeming with life."** This suggests that the greatest creation of all is a vibrant, living community filled with purpose and divine energy. It's a powerful and uplifting message that our individual acts of building and creation contribute to something far greater than ourselves.

## Prompt:
perfection..

Perfection is a state of mind

In which there is abundance of every kind

It springs from a deep well of love

As enchanting as the flight of a dove

Upto the kernel of our heart it resonates

Deep seated in our mind it liberates

There is no season in which it wont

Guide us,

Erupting from moment to moment inside us

Long we desire to exist

Continually in this state of bliss

Freed from the duality of life

Instinct driven and rid of strife

In love we find that storehouse

Which triggers activity all around us

Crystal clear like snowy springs

What joy to feel that emotion it brings

With people we keep our trysts

Helping those blow away the mists

That cloud them and rob them of bliss

Ensuring they never take life amiss

## Response:
Thank you for sharing this beautiful and inspiring poem. It's a wonderful exploration of what **perfection** truly means.

You define perfection not as something flawless or static, but as a **state of mind**. It’s an internal feeling of **abundance** and **love** that frees us from the "duality of life" and its conflicts. The poem suggests that this state is always available to us, "erupting from moment to moment inside us," and that we long to live in this constant **state of bliss**.

The poem beautifully connects this internal state to our external actions. When we find this "storehouse" of love within ourselves, it "triggers activity all around us." This isn't selfish; it's about sharing that perfection with others. Your poem says that in this state, we help people "blow away the mists" that cloud their own happiness, ensuring they "never take life amiss."

Ultimately, your poem argues that perfection isn't just about personal bliss—it's about a clear, loving, and generous way of being that helps us connect with and uplift those around us. It's a powerful vision of how inner peace can create a more harmonious world.

## Prompt:
Yama comes to make His claim

Robbing loved ones of that inner flame

That spread like the wings of an Eagle

Embracing us all, daring us to inviegle

And wrest from life all of its secrets

From dawn to dusk, sunshine to tempests

Winds that blow, moaning and groaning

That cry of the Earth making us start soaring

His net he casts, that mortal is caught

The fighting is over, the soul becomes a dot

Rest it does for a while seemingly inert

Trapped in His halls, no longer alert

Time-bound this inconscience

A brief period between existence and existence

Awake they do, a new cry of life

A joy to behold, delivered by a wife

Who nurses the baby until it grows

Serene and beautiful, timeless as a rose

Born again, to continue this cycle

Endless as time, the old familiar spectacle

## Response:
Thank you for sharing this profound and moving poem about the cycle of life and death.

The poem begins with a powerful image of **Yama**, the Lord of Death, arriving to take a loved one. You beautifully describe the life he claims as an "inner flame" that "spread like the wings of an Eagle," showing just how vibrant and expansive a person's spirit can be. This sets up the central conflict between the unstoppable force of death and our human desire to "wrest from life all of its secrets."

The middle of the poem focuses on the moment of death. The soul is caught in Yama's net, becoming a tiny, "inert" dot, "trapped in His halls." This isn't an end, but a state of "inconscience," a "brief period between existence and existence." This idea reframes death not as a finality, but as a temporary pause in a larger journey.

The conclusion of the poem is a powerful rebirth. The "brief period" ends, and the soul is reborn as a "new cry of life." The cycle continues with the image of a mother nursing her child, who grows "serene and beautiful, timeless as a rose." The final lines bring us back to the grand, continuous "spectacle" of birth, death, and rebirth, suggesting that this endless cycle is the very nature of existence.

## Prompt:
Woe unto he who lives a life

Devoid of bliss, for bliss there is even amidst strife

Dwell we do in a pool of pain

Unable to find the will to live again

Sorrow comes to strike away the crud

We've covered ourselves with - fallen in mud

Sorrow and joy, joy and sorrow, we oscillate

Failing to find that life to illuminate

Noor it's called, like a 100 splendid suns \*1

A vision so grand as to embrace everyone

The cycle wears on, the drama is wrought

Good things and bad things so dearly we've bought \*2

Experiences so engraved in our minds

Emotions that linger in all shapes and kinds

Love blossoms in our heart for that illimitable creator

Who gives us a part in the human theater

Shorn of all hope and beginning to despair

We find that divine spark and start to care

For things big and small and people who stand

Firm in their faith, touched by His hand

## Response:
Thank you for sharing this beautiful and poignant poem. It's a powerful exploration of the human experience, moving from a place of despair to one of hope and divine connection.

The poem begins with a sense of sorrow, describing a life **"devoid of bliss"** and dwelling in a **"pool of pain."** This feeling of being "unable to find the will to live again" is a raw and honest portrayal of suffering.

However, the poem suggests that even sorrow has a purpose. It's a force that strikes away the **"crud"** we've covered ourselves with, a painful but necessary cleansing. This leads to the central theme of the poem: the oscillation between **"sorrow and joy."** You capture the struggle to break free from this cycle and find the illuminating light of **"Noor"**—a beautiful reference to divine light.

This divine light, described as a **"vision so grand as to embrace everyone,"** is the turning point. It's in the midst of despair, when all hope seems lost, that we find a **"divine spark."** This spark inspires us to care for **"things big and small"** and for people who have found their own faith. This renewed sense of purpose and connection is ultimately what frees us from the cycle of suffering and fills us with love for the **"illimitable creator."**

The poem is a testament to the idea that even in our darkest moments, there is a path to finding meaning and connection, guided by a higher power. It's a journey from despair to a hopeful, enlightened state of being.

## Prompt:
Chlorophyll it is which makes a leaf green

Rain comes to drench it, making it sparkling and clean

Flowers grow and the whole vista explodes

In colours aplenty like a million rainbows

A veritable kaleidoscope this forest

Which gives a weary traveller rest

Ridding him of his burden

Making him think positive again

Feed it does many birds and insects

Deer and wolf and all of natures aspects

Nowhere else is life so concentrated

By divine Prakriti orchestrated

There are those among us who seek

To strip this forest, seemingly weak

And prone to rape, for dumb the meek

But protect her we do, though the fight seemingly bleak

Endless the horizon, green and vast

In its tranquility seemingly lost

Those of us who see acres wild

Filled with the wonder of a child

## Response:
Thank you for sharing this beautiful and evocative poem. It's a wonderful tribute to the power and importance of nature.

The poem begins with a celebration of the simple, vibrant beauty of a forest. You highlight the essential elements—**chlorophyll**, **rain**, and the "million rainbows" of **flowers**—that create a "veritable kaleidoscope." This imagery sets a scene of pure, unbridled life that offers a weary traveler a place to find rest and positive thoughts.

You then expand on the forest's role, not just as a beautiful sight, but as a source of life for a myriad of creatures, from **birds** and **insects** to **deer** and **wolf**. The poem calls this "life so concentrated," orchestrated by a divine force you name **Prakriti**, which beautifully encapsulates the sacredness you see in nature.

The tone shifts to a stark warning, acknowledging those who "seek to strip this forest." This part of the poem recognizes the fragility of nature and the ongoing struggle to protect it. The phrase "dumb the meek" is a powerful way to describe nature's vulnerability, and your commitment to protecting it, even when the fight seems **"bleak,"** shows a deep sense of responsibility.

The poem ends on a hopeful note, returning to a personal connection with nature. The "endless horizon, green and vast" is a place of peace, and those who truly see it are filled with the **"wonder of a child."** It suggests that this sense of childlike awe is what ultimately motivates us to be its guardians.
