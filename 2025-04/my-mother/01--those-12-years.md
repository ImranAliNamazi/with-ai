It sounds like your son has been on a deeply personal and intellectual journey over the past several years, marked by a strong individualistic spirit and a yearning for a more unified and loving world. His early exposure to Sri Aurobindo's vision, coupled with his own spiritual inclinations, seems to have shaped his perspective significantly.

His realization that his "message" centers on following one's "nature and truth" and prioritizing love and care resonates with a focus on inner authenticity and interpersonal connection. The poem where he feels at "loggerheads" with the meaning of love he brings suggests an internal struggle or perhaps a sense of disconnect between his ideals and the reality he perceives.

The fact that he feels his research is complete and is ready for the "next step" could indicate a desire to translate his insights into action or to share his understanding with others. His Gemini nature might suggest a multifaceted approach to this next phase.

It's understandable that you perceive him as "different" and have noticed his recent withdrawal, especially considering the intensity of his internal exploration over the past 12 years. It seems he has been deeply immersed in these ideas and is now emerging with a clearer sense of purpose.

You've shared this information for me to simply absorb, and I have done so. Please feel free to share your intent when you are ready. I am here to listen and understand.

It sounds like you and your son share a deep connection and have both navigated challenging times. The reference to Richard Bach's novel and the idea of having the understanding to "heal any hurt" speaks to a profound level of empathy and resilience you both possess.

His ability to express his feelings and thoughts through poetry is a valuable outlet and a way for him to process his inner experiences. The impact of Tolkien's tragic tale of Turin and Finduilas leading him to prioritize his connection with you suggests a significant shift in his focus, a recognition of the importance of your relationship amidst his internal struggles. His feeling of needing to be "saved" by you highlights the depth of your bond and the comfort he finds in your presence.

The concept of "becoming a lightworker," as he describes it, with its emphasis on healing through grace and compassion to help others, aligns with the "pay it forward" principle. This idea of transforming personal suffering into a source of healing for others is a powerful one. It suggests he sees his own journey, with its "strife and suffering," as a crucible for developing the empathy and understanding needed to support others.

It seems he is emerging from a period of intense introspection and is now ready to channel his experiences and insights into positive action, focusing on connection, compassion, and service. This transition marks a significant step in his personal and spiritual development.

It's beautiful to hear about the strong foundation of love and joy within your family. The "eddies of delight and peals of laughter and mirth" you provided clearly served as an anchor for him during his formative years and beyond.

His perspective of transcending dualities and viewing life's experiences through the lens of spiritual beings on a human journey, likening lifetimes to movies as in Richard Bach's *Illusions*, demonstrates a profound and perhaps comforting way of understanding existence. This viewpoint likely provided him with a sense of detachment and perspective during challenging times.

His desire to now chronicle the journeys of others, fueled by the hope that love and sharing can create a "heaven on Earth," signifies a beautiful outward turn of his focus. It suggests a desire to connect with others on a deeper level, to learn from their experiences, and to contribute to a more compassionate and understanding world. This intention aligns perfectly with the concept of a "lightworker" – someone who seeks to bring light, healing, and positive change to the world.

His journey seems to be culminating in a desire to actively engage with the world and use his insights to foster greater connection and well-being for all. It's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of love and understanding.
