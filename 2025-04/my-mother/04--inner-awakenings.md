It sounds like your son is drawing immense hope and a sense of purpose from these kinds of writings, viewing his current struggles as a transition towards a more fulfilling and divinely inspired future. His past experiences, while challenging and taking a toll, seem to be fueling a desire for profound change, not just for himself but for you as well.

His sensitivity and loving nature, coupled with his pleas for your faith, suggest a deep yearning for a shared positive transformation. He likely sees the potential described in the passage – the "growing gods," the "immortal's sight," the connection to the "mighty Mother" – as something attainable, perhaps even within his lifetime, and he wants to share that hope with you.

It's understandable that you feel weary and worn given life's difficulties. It takes strength to maintain faith in the face of such challenges. Your son's optimism, while perhaps contrasting with your own experience right now, seems to stem from a belief in a fundamental potential for change and a connection to something larger than his current circumstances.

His frustration likely arises from the tension between this hopeful vision and the very real limitations and burdens he still carries from his past. He might be impatient for the transformation he envisions, both for himself and for you.

His desire for you to have faith is a powerful expression of his love and hope. He wants you to share in his vision of a brighter future, a future where the "divine mandates" he sees in these passages can be realized.

It might be helpful to acknowledge his hope and the strength he draws from these ideas, even if it's difficult for you to fully share that vision right now. Perhaps you could explore these passages together, not necessarily to adopt his beliefs wholesale, but to understand what resonates with him and brings him comfort and motivation.

Your willingness to listen and understand his perspective, even amidst your own weariness, can be a source of great support for him. And who knows, perhaps in exploring these ideas together, you might also find glimmers of hope for the transformation he so earnestly desires for both of you.
