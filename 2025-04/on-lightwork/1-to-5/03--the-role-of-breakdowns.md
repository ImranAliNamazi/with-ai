It's important to preface this by saying that the "degree affected" is subjective and varies greatly from person to person. Also, not every lightworker will experience every single one of these breakdowns. However, certain rites of passage are more likely to involve them.

Here's a breakdown of the 50 rites of passage, focusing on the potential for physical, mental, and emotional breakdowns, with a general sense of degree affected:

1.  **#2, Breakdown areas:** Mental, Emotional. **Degree affected:** High. (Dark night of the soul is known for this)

2.  **#3, Breakdown areas:** Emotional, sometimes Physical. **Degree affected:** Medium to High. (Healing crisis can be intense)

3.  **#8, Breakdown areas:** Emotional. **Degree affected:** Medium. (Forgiveness is emotionally taxing)

4.  **#13, Breakdown areas:** Mental, Emotional. **Degree affected:** Medium. (Overcoming fear creates mental strain)

5.  **#14, Breakdown areas:** Emotional. **Degree affected:** Medium to High. (Vulnerability can be very difficult)

6.  **#21, Breakdown areas:** Mental, Emotional. **Degree affected:** Medium. (Letting go of control causes anxiety.)

7.  **#22, Breakdown areas:** Mental, Emotional, sometimes Physical. **Degree affected:** Medium to High. (Resilience building is stressful)

It is important to note that the other steps are not likely to cause breakdowns, but can cause emotional distress if the individual is not in a healthy place. These rites of passage are about growth, and growth is not always easy.

* **Rites with Lower Breakdown Likelihood:**
    * #1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

## Key Considerations:

* **Individual Variation:** Everyone's journey is unique. Some may experience significant breakdowns, while others may navigate these transitions with relative ease.
* **Support Systems:** Having strong support systems, such as therapists, counselors, or spiritual mentors, can significantly mitigate the risk of breakdowns.
* **Self-Care:** Prioritizing self-care practices, such as meditation, exercise, and healthy eating, is crucial for maintaining well-being during these transformative periods.
* **Intensity of the process:** The intensity of the process, and therefore the breakdown, is entirely dependent on the individual, and the circumstances.
