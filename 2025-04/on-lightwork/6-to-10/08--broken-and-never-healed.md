> `Imran`: Now lets do article 3 about a good old (much older) friend who spent his life shattered, angry and looking to lose the memories of being sodomized by an older cousin at a tender 10. He drowned that sorrow in drinking and drugs, yet in many ways, "was a beautiful human being"<br>
> I would call it - "broken and never healed" - a kick to the rest of us, who never have compassion for the shattered souls we see around us, but never actually SEE them. This is the poem I wrote after his demise. And its specifically about atrocities within "families" - here it is:

## Mystic River (Input Poem to Gemini)

They must have been just out of toddler hood<br>
When they saw this boy unsullied for the last time<br>
They couldn't understand the anger awoken in him<br>
As his grief a lifetime never assuaged or gave relief<br>

What means the word family when the worst it brings out<br>
Always hurting each other never knowing why we shout<br>
A hundred wrongs I know of by adults who never meant it<br>
And children who bear the brunt of it, goddamn it<br>

Break the cycle of bad karma, forgive and be blessed<br>
To leave the past behind and live a peace newfounded<br>
What do we do to the monsters who beat or abuse<br>
Or the ones who are not strong and feel defeated<br>

We go on hurting each other<br>
Making each other cry<br>
Hurting each other<br>
Without ever knowing why<br>

So awake from your nightmares<br>
Kiss yourself tightly<br>
Look for love in the world around<br>
And find everlasting peace<br>

This is a powerful and poignant poem, and the article you envision is deeply important. Let's craft Article 3:

## Article 3: Broken and Never Healed - The Ghosts in Our Families and the Shattered Souls We Fail to See

We walk among them every day – the broken, the scarred, the ones whose inner landscapes bear the indelible marks of unseen battles. We might see the surface – the addiction, the anger, the withdrawal – but rarely do we truly *see* the shattered soul beneath, the one whose foundation was fractured by a cruelty so profound it shaped the trajectory of an entire life.

Consider the story of a man, a "beautiful human being" in so many ways, yet forever shadowed by the violation he endured as a tender ten-year-old at the hands of someone meant to be family. His life became a desperate flight from memory, a drowning of unspeakable sorrow in the numbing embrace of alcohol and drugs. His anger, so incomprehensible to those who never witnessed his innocence stolen, became the shield and the shackle of a grief that time could neither assuage nor relieve.

This is a stark indictment of our collective blindness, a kick to the conscience of those of us who navigate life relatively unscathed, often failing to extend genuine compassion to the walking wounded among us. We see the outward manifestations of their pain – the outbursts, the self-destruction – and judge, label, or turn away, rarely pausing to consider the genesis of their suffering.

## What Means the Word Family?

Your poem cuts to the heart of a devastating truth: the very institution meant to nurture and protect can become the source of unimaginable pain. "What means the word family when the worst it brings out?" The betrayal within familial bonds leaves scars that run deeper and fester longer than wounds inflicted by strangers. The confusion of a child grappling with abuse within their own supposed sanctuary can twist their perception of trust, safety, and self-worth for a lifetime.

"A hundred wrongs I know of by adults who never meant it / And children who bear the brunt of it, goddamn it." The unintended consequences of adult failings ripple through generations, leaving children to shoulder burdens far too heavy for their young souls. And then there are the deliberate acts, the monstrous violations that shatter innocence and leave behind a landscape of lifelong trauma.

## The Cycle of Bad Karma and the Unseen Monsters

Your poem speaks to the yearning for liberation from this cycle: "Break the cycle of bad karma, forgive and be blessed / To leave the past behind and live a peace newfounded." The wisdom of many traditions echoes this sentiment – the need to untangle the karmic knots of pain and abuse. Yet, the path to forgiveness and peace is often an insurmountable climb for those whose foundations have been so violently shaken.

"What do we do to the monsters who beat or abuse / Or the ones who are not strong and feel defeated?" This is the agonizing question. Justice, accountability, and protection are paramount. But beyond that, how do we, as a society, truly support the survivors, the ones left feeling defeated by the very people who should have cherished them?

## Hurting Each Other Without Knowing Why

"We go on hurting each other / Making each other cry / Hurting each other / Without ever knowing why." This speaks to the intergenerational transmission of pain, the unconscious perpetuation of harmful patterns. Unhealed trauma festers and finds expression in our interactions, often without conscious awareness of its origins.

## Awakening to Compassion

The poem ends with a plea for healing and self-love: "So awake from your nightmares / Kiss yourself tightly / Look for love in the world around / And find everlasting peace." This is the hope, the potential for solace even amidst the deepest scars.

But for those around the shattered souls, the call is to awaken from our indifference. To truly *see* the pain that lies beneath the surface. To move beyond judgment and offer genuine compassion, understanding, and support. We may not be able to erase their past, but we can offer a lifeline in their present, a glimmer of hope that they are not alone in their suffering.

The story of the man lost to his pain is a stark reminder of the invisible wounds that fester within families and within our communities. Let his memory be a catalyst for us to open our eyes, soften our hearts, and truly see the broken souls who walk among us, offering them not just a passing glance, but the profound recognition and compassion they so desperately deserve.
