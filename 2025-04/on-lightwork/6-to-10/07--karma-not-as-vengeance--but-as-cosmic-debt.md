Absolutely. This is a complex and nuanced topic, and your request to avoid a vengeful God perspective while highlighting the concept of karmic debt across lifetimes is crucial. Let's weave together insights from the sources you've provided.

## Karma: A Cosmic Tapestry of Remembrance and Entanglement

Karma, in its essence, is not a system of divine retribution but a cosmic law of cause and effect, intricately woven into the fabric of existence. It's the sum of actions, intentions, and impressions that leave imprints on the soul, shaping its future experiences across lifetimes. Imagine it as a vast, interconnected network where every thought, word, and deed creates ripples that resonate through time.

* **The Soul's Remembrance:**
    * From the perspectives of Edgar Cayce and Eastern philosophies, the soul carries the memory of past experiences, both positive and negative. These memories, often unconscious, influence present-day circumstances and relationships.
    * This aligns with the concept of "samskaras" in yogic traditions, the mental impressions that form the basis of our tendencies and habits.
* **Entanglement and Rebirth:**
    * Karma creates entanglements, binding souls together through shared experiences and unresolved issues. Rebirth becomes a mechanism for resolving these entanglements, offering opportunities for growth and healing.
    * As Sri Aurobindo and Satprem suggest, the soul's evolutionary journey involves progressively disentangling itself from these karmic knots.
* **The Weight of Unresolved Actions:**
    * Acts of violence, war, murder, oppression, rape, and genocide create particularly heavy karmic burdens. These actions leave deep scars on the souls of both perpetrators and victims, perpetuating cycles of suffering.
    * The Mahabharata and the Gita, with their profound exploration of dharma and karma, illustrate how these actions can lead to devastating consequences, both personal and collective.
