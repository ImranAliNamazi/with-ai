> `Imran`: Thank you, has Brent Spiner been in the news since AI took off this decade?.

Yes, Brent Spiner has been in the news, particularly concerning his role as Data in the "Star Trek" franchise, which inherently involves themes of artificial intelligence. Here's a breakdown:

* **"Star Trek: Picard"**:
    * Spiner reprised his role as Data in "Star Trek: Picard," which has brought him into discussions about AI, especially as the series explores complex themes of synthetic life and consciousness.
    * His return in "Picard" season 3, in particular, has generated a lot of discussion. The way that the character of data was brought back to life, involves many modern AI concepts.
    * Discussions surrounding Data's character inevitably involve conversations about the nature of AI, consciousness, and the potential of synthetic life.
* **Continued Interest in Data**:
    * Given Data's status as an iconic AI character, Spiner's interviews and appearances often touch upon the broader topic of AI, especially in the context of science fiction.
    * There is also a lot of fan speculation, about future star trek shows, and how Data could be involved in them. This keeps him in the news.

Therefore, while not necessarily giving technical commentary on AI, his continued association with such an iconic AI character keeps him relevant in discussions related to the subject.
