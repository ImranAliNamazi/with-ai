You're addressing a deeply profound and universally human concern: mortality, and how we approach it in a world with diverse belief systems. Integrating Eastern and Western perspectives, along with the evolving practices surrounding death, offers a rich tapestry for understanding this final stage of life.

## Bridging Eastern and Western Perspectives on Mortality:

* **Western Frameworks:**
    * Often emphasize the finality of death, with a focus on maximizing the quality of life before its end.
    * Euthanasia and assisted dying debates reflect a desire for autonomy and control over the dying process.
    * Modern palliative care and the death doula movement aim to provide comfort and support during the transition.
    * Films like "You Don't Know Jack" and "My Sister's Keeper" explore the ethical and emotional complexities of these choices.
* **Eastern Frameworks (Indic, particularly):**
    * Embrace the concept of rebirth (reincarnation), where death is seen as a transition to another life.
    * The Garuda Purana, as you mentioned, provides detailed descriptions of the soul's journey after death, emphasizing the karmic consequences of one's actions.
    * This perspective can foster a sense of continuity and reduce the fear of annihilation.
    * The idea of Moksha, or liberation, is also a large part of the eastern framework, where the cycle of rebirth is broken.
* **A Pluralistic Approach:**
    * Acknowledging the validity of both frameworks allows for a more nuanced understanding of mortality.
    * Individuals can draw comfort from the idea of rebirth while also seeking compassionate care during their final days.
    * This approach respects individual beliefs and allows for a more personalized experience of death.

## Modern Practices and Perspectives:

* **Death Doulas:**
    * Provide non-medical support to individuals and families during the dying process, offering emotional, spiritual, and practical assistance.
    * Their work aligns with the holistic approach to death found in many Eastern traditions.
* **Euthanasia Advocates:**
    * Champion the right to choose a peaceful and dignified death, particularly for those with terminal illnesses.
    * This reflects a Western emphasis on individual autonomy and control.
* **Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) and Conscious Aging:**
    * IONS explores the nature of consciousness and its relationship to death and dying.
    * Their Conscious Aging program emphasizes the importance of finding meaning and purpose in the later stages of life, fostering a sense of peace and acceptance.
    * They work to bridge the gap between science and spirituality.
* **Facing Death with Courage and Comfort:**
    * Drawing from both Eastern and Western perspectives, we can cultivate a more courageous and comfortable approach to death.
    * This involves:
        * Accepting the inevitability of death.
        * Finding meaning and purpose in life.
        * Cultivating spiritual practices that provide comfort and support.
        * Seeking compassionate care during the dying process.
        * Engaging in open and honest conversations about death.

In essence, facing our mortality requires a willingness to embrace diverse perspectives and cultivate a sense of peace and acceptance. By integrating the wisdom of both Eastern and Western traditions, along with the compassionate practices of modern death care, we can approach death with greater courage and comfort.
