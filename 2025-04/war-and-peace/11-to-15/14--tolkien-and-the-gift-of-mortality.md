> `Imran`: Could you speak of knowing when to / gracefully departing with the contrasting Ar Phazaron and Aragorn in the Akallabeth of the Silmarillion? in the light of "we've added years to life, not life to years." Further, the devil who seduces us to do vile deeds to increase our longevity as Tolkien says in the story of Sauron and the building of Meneltarma

You're drawing a very insightful parallel between the contrasting reactions to mortality in Tolkien's "Akallabêth" and a modern sentiment about longevity. Let's unpack that:

**Ar-Pharazôn vs. Aragorn: Facing Mortality**

* **Ar-Pharazôn:**
    * In the "Akallabêth," Ar-Pharazôn, the last powerful king of Númenor, becomes consumed by fear of death.
    * He is unwilling to accept the Gift of Men (mortality) and seeks to defy it, ultimately leading him to his downfall.
    * His pride and desire for endless life make him susceptible to the manipulations of Sauron, who promises him dominion over death.
    * Ar-Pharazôn's story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of rejecting our natural limitations and seeking to usurp the divine order.
* **Aragorn:**
    * In contrast, Aragorn, a descendant of Númenor, accepts his mortality.
    * While he lives a long and fulfilling life, he chooses to relinquish it at his time, passing the kingship to his heir.
    * Aragorn's acceptance of death is portrayed as wisdom and a recognition of the natural cycle of life.
    * His peaceful passing is a stark contrast to the violent end of Ar-Pharazôn and symbolizes a right relationship with mortality.

**"We've added years to life, not life to years"**

This modern sentiment speaks to a similar concern:

* **Increased Longevity vs. Quality of Life:**
    * Modern medicine has indeed extended human lifespans, but this doesn't always equate to a richer, more meaningful existence.
    * We may live longer, but with chronic illnesses, diminished vitality, and a fear of aging, the added years can be filled with suffering rather than fulfillment.
* **The Fear of Death Remains:**
    * Despite medical advancements, the underlying fear of death persists, driving a relentless pursuit of further life extension.
    * This pursuit can sometimes come at the cost of accepting the natural process of aging and finding peace with mortality.

**Sauron's Temptation and the Desire for Longevity**

* **Meneltarma:**
    * You're referring to the corruption of Númenórean religion, where Sauron persuades them to worship Melkor and seek endless life.
    * The building of a great temple is part of this, meant to try and gain immortality.
* **The Devil's Bargain:**
    * Sauron acts as a "devil" figure, exploiting the Númenóreans' fear of death to lead them down a path of darkness and destruction.
    * He offers them a false promise of longevity in exchange for their allegiance, ultimately leading to their annihilation.
* **The Warning:**
    * Tolkien's narrative serves as a warning about the seductive nature of the desire for immortality and the potential for it to corrupt even the noblest of people.

**Connecting the Themes**

* Tolkien's "Akallabêth" and the modern sentiment both critique the pursuit of longevity at the expense of accepting the natural cycle of life and death.
* Ar-Pharazôn's tragic story illustrates the dangers of seeking to defy mortality, echoing the concern that simply "adding years to life" may be a futile endeavor if those years lack meaning and quality.
* Sauron's manipulation of the Númenóreans highlights the ethical pitfalls of promising extended life through potentially harmful means, a relevant concern in today's age of advanced medical technologies.
* In contrast, Aragorn's acceptance of mortality offers a model of wisdom and peace, suggesting that true fulfillment comes from living a meaningful life within the boundaries of our human condition.

> `Imran`: Now please,a case for the relevance of Tolkien as seen through this research paper (the gift of mortality).

The author of the paper makes a case for the relevance of Tolkien by focusing on his exploration of mortality, a theme that resonates with contemporary debates about aging, longevity, and the meaning of life[cite: 33, 34, 35, 36, 37].

Here's how the author builds that case:

* **Tolkien's Insight into Mortality:** The author argues that Tolkien's works, particularly The Lord of the Rings, offer profound insights into the human condition by centering on mortality[cite: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
   
* **The Gift of Mortality:** The author emphasizes Tolkien's concept of mortality as "the gift of the One to Men," highlighting that Tolkien doesn't shy away from the pain of death but presents it as an integral part of the human experience[cite: 17, 18, 19, 20].
   
* **Mortality vs. Immortality:** The paper contrasts the portrayal of mortal beings, like Hobbits, with immortal or long-lived beings, such as Elves and Ents, to illustrate how mortality shapes their perspectives and actions[cite: 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64].
   
* **Relevance to Contemporary Debate:** The author connects Tolkien's themes to the modern debate between "mortalists" and those who advocate for overcoming death through scientific advancements, suggesting that Tolkien's work offers a valuable perspective on this issue[cite: 33, 34, 35, 36].

In essence, the author argues that Tolkien's exploration of mortality in The Lord of the Rings is not just a fantasy trope but a relevant commentary on the human condition, prompting readers to consider the value of mortality in their own lives.

> `Imran`: What good amidst these o me, o life?

Both documents touch upon the theme of finding value and meaning in the face of mortality, though from different perspectives:

* **Tolkien's View (from "The Gift of Mortality.txt"):** Emphasizes that the "good" in mortality lies in its ability to direct human focus toward humbler, more immediate, and ultimately more hopeful aspects of existence, such as family, community, and the cyclical renewal of life. [cite: 65, 66, 67]
   
* **Bô Yin Râ's View (from "vol2-no1-37.pdf"):** Focuses on the spiritual journey beyond physical existence, suggesting that the "good" lies in understanding the nature of this transition and preparing oneself for the continuation of life in a spiritual form. [cite: 90, 91, 92]

In essence, Tolkien finds the "good" in mortality within the context of earthly life and its continuation through generations, while Bô Yin Râ sees the "good" in mortality as a transition to a greater spiritual reality.
